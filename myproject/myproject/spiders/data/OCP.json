The validity question is addressed by using evidence-centered design (ECD) methods to build an evidentiary argument. An innovative project called Mathematics Intervention Module (MIM) for helping students improve their mathematical problem solving skills is described that uses ECD methods in concert with the emerging technologies, with a focus on diagnosis, feedback, practice, and items that integrate targeted knowledge and skills.",

    "abstract": "The coarse registration is required before fine registration to obtain a better initial pose; however, it is difficult for coarse registration to obtain a better initial pose when the overlapping coefficient of source and target point cloud is low. To overcome this we propose a registration method using difference of normals (DoN) based segmentation algorithm and sample consensus initial alignment algorithm. First, the DoN based segmentation algorithm is employed to segment areas where obvious normal differences from source and target point cloud. Afterwards, Gaussian models for these subsets are established to find a pair of point cloud subsets with the most similar distribution. Then the sample consensus initial alignment algorithm (SAC-IA) is employed to register the matched subsets to obtain transformations between them, applied to source point cloud to find a better initial pose. Eventually, the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is involved to complete the registration. The experiments show the root mean square error (RMSE) of the registered point cloud using proposed method has been improved by 0.435 m compared with that of previous algorithm when the overlapping coefficient is 5%. The analysis shows the segmented region has clearer normal features; consequently, the SAC-IA algorithm to extract a more effective feature histogram to obtain a more accurate transformation.",

    "abstract": "Based on the stationary phase method combined with the angular spectrum representation, an analytical expression of the vectorial structure of the cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam diffracted at a circular aperture has been derived in the far-field. Here the vectorial structure denotes that the diffracted cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam is uniquely decomposed into the transverse electric (TE) and the transverse magnetic (TM) terms. The analytical formulae of the energy flux of the TE term, the TM term, and the diffracted cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam are also presented in the far-field, respectively. The vectorial structures of the two cases of the diffracted cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam are compared in the far-field. Under certain conditions, interesting phenomena will appear in the vectorial structures of the two cases of the diffracted cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam in the far-field, which are illustrated as examples. This research reveals the farfield structural properties of the cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam diffracted at a circular aperture. Also, this research is useful to the particle trapping, dark-field imaging, optical cage, and laser machining involving the diffracted cylindrical vector Laguerre-Gaussian beam.",

The technical specification of each type of IGBT gives the limit values of the functional temperature, which will be for example of –55ºC to 150ºC. The electrical energy dissipated in the IGBT at any direction of the current, appears under the form of a thermal energy across the junctions, where the total power lost in the crystal causes an increase of the junction temperature. In fact, this value represents only a very little part of the power available in the circuit. But it shouldn’t be forgotten that the ambient temperature represents an energetic level from which, the increase of the junction temperature is done. However, this latter can reach a value relatively increased, especially if we know that the industrial ambient temperature is very often approximately equal to 50ºC or 60ºC.",

The present paper describes the investigation of the influence of the textural configuration for polymer-non-mesogenic domain on the electrooptical characteristics of PSLC systems. This influence is studied by using such experimental techniques as polarizing electronic microscopy, differential scanning calorimetric, etc. We clear up the monomer and/or polymer concentration effect to the phase transition level of liquid crystals used. In the same time, the investigation of evolution of polymerization process by using IR dichroism experiments offers information concerning the induced ordering in the polymer domain. It is demonstrated the possibility of obtaining a rich variety of morphologies using non-mesogenic monomers, each showing a unique electro-optic response.",

Single pulse drilling at a range of powers is used to determine the minimum pulse length, and thereby energy input, required for through-hole generation. The effect on this minimum penetration energy of using pulse trains of identical 1.0 ms pulses, as well as pulse trains with a progressive increase in pulse power, was investigated. Drilling efficiency was improved by both multiple 1.0 ms pulses and progressively increasing pulses, with the multiple pulses having a greater effect, typically increasing efficiency by 35%.

Additionally, the weld surface in laser-leading mode is bright and with a little depression, while it performs dark and slight upheaval in arc-leading mode. The conclusion is drawn that the prime difference of the synergistic interaction between the laser and arc in hybrid welding is that laser breaks the oxidation layer firstly in laser-leading mode which leads to different utilization of the energy.

    "abstract": "Lidar has long been used in three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction tasks. Herein a novel method using single layer Lidar and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is proposed, which is expected to replace the multiple layer lidar in perceiving surrounding environment. The reconstruction is achieved in three steps: (i) Coordinate transformation and timestamp synchronization between the two sensors are first performed; (ii) The quaternion attitude is then calculated to generate the scanned plane by using the original range, roll, pitch, and yaw data measured; and (iii) The registrations between different frames of scanned planes are finally achieved by the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Together, the 3-D spatial reconstruction can be obtained by using an IMU and a single layer, rather than multiple layer, lidar, which is more economical and flexible.",

    "abstract": "Differential evolution algorithm (DE) is a very popular algorithm which is used to solve numerical optimization problems. The process of DE is implemented with the help of three operators known as mutation, crossover and selection. These operators are designed by mapping the theory of natural selection and evolution. Simplicity of DE motivated many scientists to apply this algorithm for solving real life optimization problems. Although it performed well in solving many optimization problems, yet it was noticed that in some problems, it tends to stick in local optimal solution. Several new variants of DE were developed to solve stagnation problem either by changing the mutation or crossover strategy of DE or by performing parameter tuning. The research of creating fast variant of DE is still on and is dependent on the technique used for implementing the algorithms. Motivating from idea of developing new variant of DE, we did some changes in mutation and crossover operator DE algorithms and created Modified Differential Evolution Algorithm (MDE). We updated mutation operator of MDE to provide more bandwidth for creating diverse solutions and updated crossover operator to make it more effective in exploiting the region around good solutions. The proposed approach not only improves the convergence rate of DE algorithm but is also very useful in maintaining the diversity among solutions. For checking the performance of proposed algorithm, it is compared with other state of art algorithms. The result verifies that proposed approach is good as compared to other latest DE variants.",

The photochromic additive undergoes a reversible ring-opening reaction resulting in a significant increase of its dipole moment. Due to charge-dipole interactions, dipolar traps are formed on the polymer chain in the vicinity of dispersed polar species. The charge carrier trap formation was checked by photocurrent kinetics measurements. At the same time the capacitance of the system was found to increase due to the formation of dipolar species. The calculations show that the presence of dipolar species in the vicinity of an MEH-PPV chain modifies the on-chain site energies and consequently increases of the width of distribution of hopping transport states. The influence of various levels of energetic disorder of chain hopping states on the charge carrier mobility was described by means of the tight–binding approximation model. It was shown that the increasing disorder destroys the resonance between charge carrier energies on adjacent sites, and therefore limits the diffusive charge carrier motion. Thus, the transport properties of a polymer chain can be reversibly changed by a photochromic reaction of the additive.",

    "abstract": "Consumer demands are moving away from standardized to customized products, as such, the evolution of alternative manufacturing techniques has become imperative. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process of building components layer by layer as against the traditional methods which are subtractive in nature. Though AM offers lots of advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques, its wide application is still however in the infancy phase. Despite all the benefits derived from AM technology, there are still a lot of unresolved issues with the technology that has hindered its performance thereby limiting its application to high tolerant jobs. This paper takes a look at some important AM technologies, some problems currently facing AM technology at large and proposes some solutions to these problems. A major known drawback in AM is poor dimensional accuracy and poor surface finish, only the layer height and melt pool temperature are controlled to solve this problem in the literature. The stair-stepping effect in adaptive manufacturing is rooted in a natural phenomenon of surface tension which is the cause of the poor surface finish and in combination with other factors is responsible for the poor dimensional accuracy. An adaptive controller is proposed for removing stair-stepping effect to improve the dimension accuracy, the surface finish and the mechanical properties of the components. Successful implementation of these proposed controllers will greatly improve the performance of AM technologies and also aid its wide application for end use products. Further research work is also suggested to improve the overall AM performance.",

Spiking neural P systems are such types of computing systems. In this paper we survey spiking neural P systems (i.e., neural-like membrane computing models) with learning ability, their architecture, learning mechanism and compare these models, discuss their advantages and disadvantages and application of these models in solving real-world problems. We further discuss the learning mechanism of associative memory network based on spiking neural P systems with white holes and weights.

The effects of laser processing parameters such as pulse repetition frequency, pulse energy and power on the volume ablation rate, material removal efficiency, thermal damage and kerf taper angle were explored, and the related mechanism of infrared (IR) femtosecond laser processing CFRP was discussed. The parameters combination for IR femtosecond laser processing CFRP was determined, so that the efficiency, kerf quality and mechanical properties were qualified; namely, the repetition frequency of 100 kHz and pulse energy of 40 μJ. The tensile strength of processed samples reached 519.3 MPa, which was 10.5% higher than that of drilled samples.

The erosion resistance of nickel aluminide IC coating and IMC coating with WC reinforcement were improved by a factor of 1.4 and 1.7, respectively. The ordered intermetallic structure and high work hardening ability was attributed to better erosion resistance of the nickel aluminide IC coatings. The strength of IC coatings further improved by the WC particles, which precipitated along the grain boundaries of the nickel aluminide matrix; improving the erosion resistance. The poor performance of IMC coatings with TiC reinforcement was due to the presence of unmelted and partially melted TiC particles in the matrix which acted as initiation sites for erosive attack. This demonstrated that the microstructural features and the choice of reinforcement addition were important in improving the erosion resistance. The hardness and elastic modulus were correlated with the erosion resistance. It was concluded that the hardness alone could not improve the solid-liquid impact erosion resistance of the coatings.",

    "abstract": "To improve the measurement accuracy of subgrade surface settlement deformation monitoring, this study proposes a high precision, long-term, automatic online monitoring system for subgrade surface settlement imaging. First, the working principle and working mode of the online monitoring system for subgrade surface settlement are introduced. Second, the key technologies of the monitoring system is introduced. For the problem that the relative position of the target-illumination camera in the monitoring system is deflected via train vibration, the pose measurement system is proposed and a method of position and attitude calculation (p4p) for rectangular four feature points of the target surface is proposed. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the pose measurement method proposed in this study can solve the rotation angle error less than 0.09°, and the relative angle error is 1.003% when the relative deflection angle is less than 2°, which can be effectively applied to the subgrade images in the settlement online monitoring system. The in situ testing results illustrated that the monitoring system corrected by the pose measurement system avoids the detection of non-real subgrade settlement and improves the measurement accuracy. We also compared the cumulative error of the monitoring system with the manual observation error for 10 months and found the error values were less than 1 mm, which meets the requirements of subgrade surface settlement monitoring.",

The FT-Raman spectrometer consist of a Michelson interferometer, a self-designed photon counter and a reference photo-detector. The evaluation methodology of the spectral information, contrary to the commercial devices that commonly use the zero-crossing method, is carried out by re-sampling the Raman scattering and by accurately extracting the optical path information of the Michelson interferometer. The FTRaman arrangement has been built using conventional parts without disregarding the spectral frequency precision that usually such a FTRaman instruments deliver. No additional complex hardware components or costly software modules have been included in this FT-Raman device. The main Raman lines from the spectra obtained with the three FT-Raman devices have been compared with the Raman lines from the standard Raman spectra of these two materials. The values obtained using the FT-Raman spectrometer prototype have shown a frequency accuracy comparable to that obtained with the commercial devices without facing the need for a large investment. Although the proposed FT-Raman prototype cannot be directly compared to the last generation of FT-Raman spectrometers from the commercial manufacturers, such a device could give an opportunity to users that require high frequency precision in their spectral analysis and are provided with rather scarce resources.",

To obtain multiscale microtextures in a micromould, a first pass of laser marking was used to increase the roughness of the original surface. Then a second pass of laser marking was used to manufacture periodic groove microstructures on the micromould. Thereafter, LSI was used to replicate the multiscale microtextures of the micromould on the sample surface. The surface morphology, wettability and surface roughness of samples fabricated at different laser shock energies were investigated. The experimental results indicate that the sample can successfully replicate the microtextures of the micromould surface after LSI and the greater the laser shock energy, the higher the degree of replication of the sample to the microtextures of the micromould. As the laser shock energy increases from 620 to 1290 mJ, the profile and roughness of microtextures of sample surface gradually close to those of micromould. In addition, the static contact angles measurement results show that the sample surface wettability changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after LSI, and the contact angles increase with the increase of laser shock energy. Due to the anisotropic wettability, the static contact angles perpendicular to groove microstructures are apparently larger than that in the parallel direction. The maximum static contact angles of the sample in perpendicular and parallel directions are 124 and 109°, respectively, when the laser shock energy was 1290 mJ. This work provides a new approach for fabricating hydrophobic surfaces, which can realize the wider practical production value of LSI in the direction of preparing superhydrophobic surfaces.",

    "abstract": "To explore the relationship of morphology and surface roughness on laser textured TC4 titanium alloy, both the process experiment and the numerical simulation approaches were adopted. The physical model of laser texturing pit was established under the condition of single pulse energy of 100, 150 and 200 mJ laser pulses irradiation using the COMSOL Multiphysics software, and the physical process of laser texturing was analysed, which laid a theoretical foundation for subsequent process experiments. A laser diode pumped Nd:YAG laser texturing experimental setup was build up. The process parameters, which are laser pulse energy, pulse width and defocusing amount included, were investigated with the monofactor analysis method. The roughness of laser texturing surface was measured from 0.71 to 13.86 μm, and the effects of these processing parameters on the surface roughness and pits morphology were analysed. Based on the morphological parameters, a mathematical integration algorithm for roughness was designed to simulate the laser texturing surface roughness, and the relationship between pit morphology and surface roughness was built up. After compared the calculated values with experimental results, it was proved that the algorithm can effectively reflect the surface roughness of samples. The experimental results show the guiding significance for the high-quality engineering application of laser texturing on titanium alloys.",

Laser pulse parameter is introduced to modify the laser pulse intensity distribution at the irradiated surface; in which case, increasing laser pulse parameter results in the laser peak intensity shift from the irradiated spot centre towards the irradiated spot edge. An experiment was carried out to validate the predictions of particle distribution in the irradiated region. It is found that predictions of the particle distribution in the resolidified meltpool agree well with the experimental data. Increasing laser pulse parameter lowers the maximum temperature significantly in the meltpool and modifies the meltpool geometry and reduces the meltpool size. Increasing the number density of WC particles lowers slightly the maximum temperature and the depth of the meltpool, which is attributed to the high melting temperature of WC particles as they remain in the solid phase in the meltpool.",

Multiplier Accumulator (MAC) is an integral unit of almost every DSP chip. MAC is highly responsible for efficient implementation of DSP applications such as digital filtering, speech processing, video coding, CDMA and many others. The MAC architecture is based on generation of partial products using Modified Booth algorithm and then construction of Binary trees using 4–2 compressor circuits. Innovative logic design style such as Complementary Pass Transistor Logic (CPL) and Complementary Pass Transistor Logic-Transmission Gate (CPL-TG) are used for implementation of Booth encoder and 4–2 compressor. A 16-bit MAC circuit using the proposed architecture is prototyped in 0.35 micron CMOS technology. In comparison to published results, a remarkable improvement in speed of around 1.5 times and reduction in silicon area, at a trade of marginal increase in power dissipation is achieved by the proposed design. These positive results will be more pronounced in reduced transistor feature size, which suggest the development of new generation MAC that may be benefited from proposed logic design. The delay and power dissipation performance can be further improved by proper design of interconnects and optimal repeater insertion. This paper presents the design details.",

    "abstract": "Recently a synthesis method for ternary reversible circuit using Max-Min algebra has been introduced, which synthesizes the circuit as a cascade of multiple-controlled unary gates. It has been shown that this method outperforms the previous TGFSOP-based method in terms of both quantum cost and number of ancilla inputs. We propose two techniques for online testing of ternary reversible circuits synthesized using multiple-controlled unary gates, one for testing a single line fault and another for testing a single fault of any fault model. For this purpose, we propose two new ternary reversible gates, namely a modified Feynman gate and extended multiple-controlled unary gates. We show realizations of these gates using elementary unary and M-S gates. In both the online testable circuits, one pre-fix and another post-fix circuit are added to the original circuit. For online testing of a single line fault, the multiple-controlled unary gates of the original circuit are replaced by their corresponding extended multiple-controlled unary gates. For online testing of a single fault of any fault model, for each multiple-controlled unary gate of the original circuit, we add an additional multiple-controlled unary gate with different target operation. We experimented with 24 benchmark logic functions of up to five variables. For online testing of a single line fault, on average the proposed technique requires 29.77% quantum cost overhead. For online testing of a single fault of any fault model, on average the proposed technique requires 123.94% quantum cost overhead.",

We note first that CTC traversal can be interpreted in two distinct ways, depending on ones understanding of spacetime. Focussing on one interpretation leads us to develop a toy universe in which no CTC can be traversed by a computer more than once, whence no direct computational speedup is possible. Focussing on the second (and more standard) interpretation leads to the surprising conclusion that CTCs may act as perfect information repositories: just as black holes have entropy, so do CTCs. If we also assume P = NP, we find that all observers agree that, even if unbounded time travel existed in their youth, this capability eventually vanishes as they grow older. Thus the computational assumption P = NP is also an assumption concerning cosmological structure.",

The surface roughness and residual stress post laser shock peening (LSP) were carefully evaluated using the optical profiler and X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Results showed that there was an increase in the surface roughness with an increase in the laser power density and a decrease with the increasing overlapping rate and the number of impacts caused by the micropit and convex deformation on the surface.

The most widespread practice is the ground scheduling applications, and specifically, gate assignment optimization. An appropriate and efficient gate assignment is of great importance in airport ground operations since it plays a major role in increasing revenues. In this paper, a multi-objective gate assignment problem (MOGAP) is formulated with the objectives of maximizing gate allocation, minimizing passenger walking distance and maximizing flight to gate preference and a solution strategy based on the evolutionary Single Leap Big Bang – Big Crunch optimization method is developed. The MOGAP is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) quadratic assignment problem. In the literature, to the best of our knowledge, there is only a single effort to solve the MOGAP for obtaining a pareto front representation of solutions by utilizing nature inspired computation methods. As the major contributions of this paper, a novel multi-objective nature inspired solution technique is proposed and high fidelity problem instance generation is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been illustrated by comparing the simulation results of the method with the previously reported algorithm both on artificially generated problem instances and real world data obtained from Turkey’s biggest airport, Atatürk International in Istanbul.",

Conventional method of measuring the surface roughness using stylus instrument is intrusive and an offline process.

Surface laser speckle line images were acquired using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a one-dimensional (1-D) image signal for each specimen was obtained MATLAB software.

    "abstract": "As CMOS devices are shriveling to nanometer regime, increasing the consequences in short channel effects and variations in process parameters. It leads to cause the reliability of the circuit also the performance. To solve the issues of CMOS devices, Fin-FETs are considered as a promising candidate for today’s electronic devices for low-voltage digital and analog circuit application. In this paper, we adduced a low-voltage two stage operational amplifier (OP-AMP) based on emerging Fin-FET technology. The proposed Fin-FET based operational amplifiers performance characteristics are studied and compared with the existing CMOS technology at 45nm scale. The opamp performance characteristics are obtained by employing Cadence Virtuoso tool for circuit simulation at 0.9V input supply voltage. The low leakage current, low parasitic resistance and high current driving abilities of the Fin-FET technology are taken into realization with basic analog building block opamp circuit. The benefit of employing Fin-FET rather than CMOS technique is the significant reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by employing Fin- FET technology the improvement in slew rate has been significantly achieved. The settling time also has been improved from 0.099μs to 0.094μs. The simulation results are given and concluded.",

ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA) software has been used to simulate the temperature distribution and deformation of the 304 stainless steel circular plate. The quality of the final shape is confirmed by comparing the average 𝑧-displacement and relative variation of 𝑧-displacement (RVZD) at the outer circumference of the plate top surface. The results revealed that the lowest radius of a spiral with the highest number of spiral turns (within the present range of study) would provide a better bowl-shape with minimal distortions at the outer circumference on the top surface; moreover, when spiral irradiation is used, a better bowl shape, with a higher uniformity in displacement at the outer rim, is obtained with a plate having thickness larger than 1.0 mm.",

We show also that the DNA-based GPEs can be applied in small switchable transmission electrochromic cells, showing good electrochemical reversibility and change of color from transparent to blue. Moreover good conductivity, combined with the large transparency range and good adhesion to the electrodes, make DNA very promising materials to be used as gel electrolytes in electrochromic devices.

Landauer formalism combined with both Density Functional Theory and Non- Equilibrium Green’s Function has used to determine electronic transport characteristics of this quasi one-dimensional optical switch. Two metallic single walled carbon nanotube (4, 2) electrodes have been used to provide favorable channel for charge transfer. The charge migration from the molecular junction governs considerable difference in conducting current. This tunneling current is relatively small due to the weak coupling between the molecule and the electrodes. This bio molecular switch has operated in Coulomb-blockade regime. The bio molecule comprises its switching property between straightened (‘OFF’) to 90° twisted (‘ON’) form upon photo excitation. HOMOLUMO gaps and the spatial distribution of the molecule are discussed in detail using Hilbert space spanned based basis functions of the bio molecule. The theoretical results show that this molecule conducts up to 23mA current when it has been twisted at 90° than the straighten form. This property suggests this system has attractive prospective application in future generation optical bio molecular switch technology. Electrical doping process has been introduced for this analytical model of p-i-n switch. This process enhanced the quantum -ballistic current transmission through the scattering region of the molecule.",

Using a CA model, various complex systems can be simulated by updating the states of calculation cells based on the local interaction rules. This approach is suitable to verify qualitative features of DNA computing, because it is operated through the local interaction between complimentary strands of DNAs. Here we investigate the cryptosystem using a DNA motif called a triple crossover (TX) tile using a CA model. We aim at improving the problems that prevent the system from realizing the sufficient performance in the selfassembly process of a calculation sheet of TX tiles. Our results indicate that such problems connect deeply into stability issues of local interaction. There are several problems to solve in order to realize practical applications of DNA computing such as DNA cryptosystem.We expect that CA analyses will provide effective solutions to them.",

In this paper a fast symmetric normalization is presented. By sharing the channels between linear correlator and monitor at large delay time, the requirement of hardware resource is reduced dramatically.

Making a correct decision under multiple criteria is regarded as a really difficult process. This procedure gets more and more difficult when group decision making problem is addressed, since it is needed to satisfy group consensus as well. Therefore, many multi attribute decision making (MADM) methods have been developed and they have used widely preferred by decision makers to rank alternatives with respect to several attributes. In this paper, three of the decision making methods, Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution), FuzzyVIKOR (‘VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) Method, Fuzzy Axiomatic Design (FAD) are handled so as to emphasize the differences and similarity between Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR and between Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy Axiomatic Design. Moreover the assessment of candidates among several applicants is one of the most strategic processes in human resources management. In this context, methods are applied to a real case staff selection problem for nurse position in a hospital. The findings of this paper illustrate that Fuzzy TOPSIS and FAD have identical candidate rankings. However, Fuzzy VIKOR has suggested a different ranking than Fuzzy TOPSIS and FAD.",

However, real-time application of the available CA models in traffic control systems is a difficult task due to their discrete and stochastic nature. This paper introduces a novel method for simulation of signalised traffic streams, which combines CA and fuzzy numbers. The introduced traffic simulation algorithm eliminates main drawbacks of the CA approach, i.e. necessity of multiple Monte Carlo simulations and calibration issues. Computational cost of traffic simulation for the proposed algorithm is considerably lower than the cost of simulation based on stochastic CA. Thus, the simulation results can be obtained in a much shorter time. Experiments confirmed that the simulation results for the introduced algorithm are consistent with that observed for stochastic CA. The proposed simulation algorithm is suitable for real-time applications in traffic control systems.",

The morphology of the film was observed under the optical microscope, surface profiler and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The roughness of the centre area of the film is about 108 nm and the average thickness of the film is about 308 nm determined by laser confocal microscope system. Also the elemental composition of the film contains Cr determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The adhesion of the film was good tested by tape, acid, alkali and organic solvents. The mechanism of coating thin film was also discussed. The result is that the morphology, thickness, roughness and adhesion of the film are good and the film is obtained through the process of amorphous change.

The parameter setting studied in this paper includes the probability of crossover and the probability of mutation, chromosome length, population size and maximum number of generations. Moreover, following the philosophy of soft computing, that is, searching for synergy among different methods to jointly solve a problem, the Design of Experiments method (DOE) is introduced to find the best combination of these parameters values. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine the main and interaction effects of the considered parameters. Results verified the efficacy of the proposed systematic tuning approach for RIMEP to solve reversible design problems, including one in the context of Multiple-valued Logic.",

    "abstract": "n the presented work the linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of poled guest-host polymer systems are calculated. Two different systems were investigated, both considering poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and derivatives of the pyrazolo-quinilines (PAQ). As a tool for the quantum chemical calculations, the molecular dynamic simulations of the considered systems were performed. Using structures simulated by molecular dynamics, the permanent local field, applied to compute polarizability a and b of the PAQ chromophores, was calculated. The electrical properties of the considered chromophores were computed with density functional theory (DFT). The permanent local fields in the bulk are small; however, their effects on the first hyperpolarizabilities are comparably large. Refractive indices and second-order susceptibilities corresponding to second harmonic generation (SHG) are calculated using a local field approach. The system PAQ1/PMMA can be well-described by the point-dipole approach, whereas for PAQ2/PMMA only distributed molecular response models can yield reasonable results.",

We address this issue in relation with the density of states and the vacuum field fluctuations. Our model is somewhat different from previous ones; while not in contradiction. Our approach is based on the concept of modulation of the vacuum field fluctuations instead of the concept of density of states. This approach, based on the Fermi’s golden rule and the demonstration that electromagnetic confinement leads to an anomalous field commutation relation for field operators, preserves the original physical meaning of “mode” and “state”. Our point of view leads to the same conclusion about the intensification and inhibition of the transition rate without resort to the concept of density of states. To formally illustrate this finding, we present our end results in relation to parametric fluorescence (parametric down conversion, also known to be triggered by vacuum field fluctuations). It is shown that parametric fluorescence can be enhanced by orders of magnitude when it occurs in a suitable cavity. We finally suggest that parametric fluorescence might be a useful tool to probe any anomaly inside microcavities.",

In order to verify the FEA model, benchmark simulations are performed verified with available experimental results. Results show that predicted residual stresses agree well with the experimental data. A point to be noted from the results is that welding tensile residual stress can be modified and changed into compressive residual stress due to laser shock processing. Parametric study of influences of LSP parameters on welding tensile residual stress, such as full width at half maximum (FWHM), power density, spot size and number of shots, have been analysed. Some optimized parameters of LSP can be made by employing the results of the parametric investigations.",

From these fundamental properties the melt depth for any material can be predicted using a simple theory. By considering the mean enthalpy of the surface, the transition from conduction limited melting to keyholing can also be accurately predicted.

The algorithm makes the association judgment only be performed between the sensor tracks and the system tracks, which greatly reduce the number of the track pairs needed to be judged, and improve the efficiency of track association algorithm. The difference degree of two tracks is acquired based on integral idea during the association judgment period, then the track with minimum difference degree is selected as the associated pair, which has considered of the historical and current data and improves association accuracy in the dense target environment.

Parity-check code is a well-known, low-cost, and effective approach. One way of adding parity-check digits in ternary logic is to compute both 1’s and 2’s parities separately. In this way, two redundant ternary digits (two trits) are appended to a block of data (dataword). This paper suggests another method which uses only a single parity digit with the same minimum Hamming distance of two. Therefore, one trit error is detectable for both methods.

In this paper we used the pulse excitation technique as it is non-contact, easy used and not affecting the sample, reliable, low cost, and accurate and suiting a wide variety of rubbery materials and elastomers. The samples chosen for this work is made of butadiene acrylonitrile rubber (NBR), which are loaded by different phr of N774 nanocarbon. The measured sample is prepared in form of 200 mm long string, having a homogenous circular cross-section of 3 mm diameter. A mechanical pulse is produced and delivered to the fixed end sample by mean of a punch from a small solenoid motor plunger. To generate a shadowgraph for the vibrating sample on a silicone photodiode, a laser beam is used. A storage oscilloscope is used to capture the natural resonance amplitude decay profile of the test sample from the obtained electric signal. The internal friction is obtained by mathematical analysis of the acquired data.",

In this study a cellular automata model of self-organizing traffic signal system is proposed, which enables evolutionary optimization of the control rules. Fitness function, which guides the evolution of control rules, is evaluated via traffic simulation by using a microscopic cellular automata model. According to the proposed approach, relevant control rules are initially determined by using a clustering algorithm. Subsequently, an evolutionary strategy is applied to optimize the control rules. Decisions about switching the traffic signals are made by using control rules that are applicable for current traffic state. The k-nearest neighbours algorithm is employed for selection and fusion of the applicable control rules. Results of simulation experiments clearly show that the proposed approach can achieve a significantly reduced vehicular delay when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for the self-organizing traffic signals.",

We decompose the network into several segments that are coupled through junctions.

Our goal is to build a numerical model that can be run over a distributed grid infrastructure, thus offering a large amount of computing resources.

The dependence of diffusion coefficient on composition and temperature has been studied for all polymeric samples. The diffusion coefficient in cationic samples increases with an increase in the oil contents in the samples. In thermal samples, it decreases with an increase in oil contents. The nano-composite samples show less diffusion coefficient than pristine polymer and it decreases with an increasing amount of linseed oil. The diffusion coefficient increases with an increase in temperature for all polymer samples. The sorption coefficient shows a little change with variation in composition as well as temperature for all the samples and it is in a range of 1. The activation energy for diffusion and permeation is positive for all the samples. The heat of sorption is also positive for all the samples, indicating Henry type mode of sorption.",

The proposition of the fuzzy sets is motivated by the need to capture and represent real life case data with uncertainty due to imprecise measurement.

In digital shearography, flaws are usually detected based on the abnormity of fringes obtained when the derivative of displacement at the area with flaw is much larger than at the area without flaw. However, there are many flaws which are difficult to be identified directly from the distribution of fringes in digital shearography. Therefore, a new method is proposed to detect these flaws difficult to be identified in this paper. The proposed method can be used to detect the flaws located inside an object, which are difficult to be identified from the distribution of fringes in digital shearography, based on the distribution of the second derivative of displacement. Though the proposed method can not be used to accurately determine the size and shape of a flaw located inside an object because of the complexity of both the flaw and the material used, it can still be used for analyzing the existence and the position of a flaw inside the object. Both theoretical analysis and experimental verification are presented in the paper, and the result obtained in the paper has shown that the theoretical analysis and the experimental verification are in a good agreement.",

Sub-micron sized aragonite may contribute to the development of composite materials with applications in sensor building or bio-materials. Aragonite precipitation was studied experimentally by controlled double jet precipitation using calcium nitrate tetra hydrate and potassium carbonate solutions of various concentrations. The influence of working conditions, meaning reaction medium, additives and ultrasonic field, on the final solid product morphology and particle size distribution was investigated. The reaction medium was either bi-distilled water or a mixture of bi-distilled water and alcohols. Ultrasonic field was applied in several experimental runs. Solid phase composition was identified by FT-IR spectroscopy and by powder X-ray diffraction. Particle size distribution was measured using a laser beam particle size analyzer and a microscopic technique. TEM was performed using a JEOL 200CX electron microscope to obtain a relevant image of the solid structure. A mathematical model in terms of population balance equation was derived. The kinetic parameters characterizing the overlapping mechanisms: nucleation, growth and agglomeration were estimated to get a theoretical insight of the process. The mathematical model derived proved to correctly represent the mechanisms involved in the precipitation of aragonite. The evaluation of kinetic parameters will allow developing mathematical models to design precipitation processes with predefined particle size distributions.",

    "abstract": "Although thermal transport in silicon is dominated by phonons in the solid state, electrons also participate as the system approaches, and exceeds, its melting point. Thus, the contribution from both phonons and electrons must be considered in any model for the thermal conductivity of silicon near the melting point. In this work, the phononic contribution to the bulk thermal conductivity of silicon is determined for the Stillinger-Weber potential in equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations for temperatures ranging from 1400 K to 2000 K . It is found that, although the contribution of electron-hole pair diffusion to high temperature conductivity of solid silicon is not included in classical molecular dynamics simulations, the Stillinger-Weber potential overestimates the vibrational contribution to thermal conductivity and, incidentally, reproduces quite well the total thermal conductivity of the solid phase up to the melting temperature. As for the liquid phase conductivity, the Stillinger-Weber potential agrees with theoretical treatment of the phononic thermal transport and predicts a minor phononic contribution of about 3% to the total liquid phase thermal conductivity. Thus, atomistic modeling of thermal transport in liquid phase silicon must include a description of the electronic contribution, e.g., through a combination of the molecular dynamics method with the continuum treatment of the electronic thermal conductivity within the two-temperature model.",

Thermal stress field is also obtained through coupling heat and thermal stress equations with the heat equation. The integral transforms are used to obtain the solutions of the coupled equations. The inversion of the Laplace transform is performed using second shifting theorem of Laplace transform while Mathematica is used for the inverse Fourier cosine transform. It is found that temperature rise in the irradiated region is rapid during the heating pulse because of the volumetric heat source incorporated in the analysis. Temperature decay is also rapid in the early cooling periods; however, as the cooling period progresses, temperature decay becomes gradual. Thermal stress is compressive and it shows a wave behaviour within the substrate material.",

The primary sources of manufacturing variation include Deposition, Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP), Etching, Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET). Process variations manifest themselves as the uncertainties of circuit performance, such as delay, noise and power consumption. Environmental variations, such as supply voltage and temperature variations, also impact circuit delay and noise. Transistor performance depends heavily on gate and other dimensions. A 10% transistor gate variation can translate to as much as a variation of -15% to +25% in gate delay.

In order to study the effect of ODH treatment, specimens were laser surface melted under ambient atmosphere by different laser input power and scan speed. Characteristic features of the ODH surface were revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The composition of the ODH scales were measured by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The microhardness of the ODH scales and the TC4 substrate were identified by microhardness tester. The load was 100 g with a holding time 15 seconds. The wear performance was also evaluated. The surface layer comprises an oxidised rutile TiO2 layer and an underlying oxygen diffusion hardening zone. And it has been found that the surface oxidised layer was adherent to the substrate. The oxygen concentration was gradually decreased from the outmost surface to the substrate. The microhardness was found to be as high as 927 HV, while the substrate had a microhardness of about 340 HV. The laser ODH treated TC4 titanium alloy exhibited significantly improved abrasive wear resistance.",

The conventional laser cladding and follow-up feed pulse current-assisted laser cladding were comparatively studied, and the influences of follow-up feed pulse current on the morphology, porosity, microstructure and cracks of the Ni60A Ni-based alloy coating prepared on the substrate surface of a 42CrMo structural alloy steel were analysed. Results showed that most current would be brought into the molten pool via the skin effect of pulse current when the follow-up feed electrode was used, thereby improving the current utilization efficiency. In addition, the approximate electrode distance could greatly increase the current density, enhance the improvement effect, and facilitate the preparation of a cladding coating with few defects and high quality. Compared with conventional laser cladding, the follow-up feed pulse current-assisted laser cladding could not only improve the cladding efficiency but also refine the grains at the cladding layer, reduce its porosity, and homogenize the microstructure of cladding layer; moreover, the dendritic crystal formed by the conventional laser cladding was transformed into isometric crystals. In the conventional laser cladding, the porosity was 0.62%, and the average grain size was approximately 6 μm. The two figures for the specimen obtained through the follow-up feed pulse current-assisted laser cladding were 0.39% and 4 μm. Meanwhile, the residual thermal stress and cracking sensitivity of the cladding layer could be reduced. Especially, online self-healing of cracks at the cladding layer could be realized by virtue of the flow-around effect and Joule heating effect formed by the high energy density pulse current, which was exclusive for the small electrode distance of follow-up feed electrodes at crack tip of the cladding layer and, thus, a crack-fee cladding layer was formed, and the easy cracking problem of laser cladding layer was solved.",

Seventy-nine undergraduate students, all preservice teachers, in four sections of an educational technology course participated in the study by responding to journal prompts and completing the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Academic performance was measured with course assignments and the final grade for the course. Each of the four sections was assigned, intact, to one of four sets of journaling prompts: reflexive prompts only, reflective prompts only, both prompts, and no prompts. The results of the preplanned data analysis found no significant differences. The results are presented in support of the value of reporting findings that do not meet the traditional standards significance.

These variables are voltage, current, charge and flux.

To relate charge and flux a new fourth fundamental element was invented that give mathematical expression between charges and flux; this element known as Memristor. Memristor is a two terminal passive element that was invented in 1971 by Leon O. Chua. Memristor name indicate that it is a combination of memory and Resistor that is the reason behind its use as a memory and it is nonvolatile in nature that is if power supply is off data will not get lost because it remembers the recent value of charge that has passed through it. Memristor is used in digital circuits, analog circuits and in memory. In this paper design of Memristor model with the help of Verilog-A model in cadence virtuoso tool has been done.",

To solve these problems, this paper presents ferroelectric-based logic circuits called Flexible Ferroelectric-Capacitor (FFC) elements for logic-in-memory architectures. In an FFC element, storage and a logic function are integrated on non-volatile ferro-electric-capacitors to achieve low power and area-efficiency. Moreover, the FFC elements are designed to flexibly change the access transistor network to achieve high functionality and programmability to change the function. In this paper, FFC elements for binary logic and for multiple-valued logic are proposed. The FFC elements are evaluated using HSPICE simulations and compared to the equivalent CMOS circuits. Both of the FFC elements for binary logic and for multiple-valued logic consume no power in the standby state, and reduce the transistor count and the dynamic energy consumption by respectively more than 94% and more than 65%.",

What he probably meant was that in everyday life probabilities play a crucial role in our decision making. Almost 300 years later, the problem of learning new things from a knowledge base has become even more important. In order to more precisely model probabilistic reasoning in knowledge bases, researchers have applied statistical methods within Logic Programming systems, so that learning that something is True or False comes with a certain probability. However, since Russell’s proposal of his famous “who shaves the barber” paradox, it has become clear that the semantics of the languages we use to describe the world we live in is multi-valued. In this paper, we introduce a statistical approach to logic programs by combining Well- Founded Semantics (which captures the core in Russell’s paradox) with probabilistic inference. The result is a Probabilistic Logic Programming framework where uncertainty in inference can be described using both a third logic value, and statistical information from probabilities.",

Since thermal separation of electron and lattice subsystems takes place during short pulse heating, energy transfer from the electron subsystem towards the lattice subsystem is formulated through the electron-phonon coupling parameter. Equivalent equilibrium temperature is introduced to quantify the phonon intensity distribution inside the film. It is found that electron excess energy gain from the irradiated field is high in the early heating period, which results in rapid rise of electron temperature. Because of electron-phonon collisions, the rise of equivalent equilibrium temperature in the lattice site becomes gradual in the early heating period. As the heating period progresses, equivalent equilibrium temperature increases rapidly and as electron excess energy gain reduces, equivalent equilibrium temperature becomes gradual in the lattice subsystem.",

The Fresnel absorption model is used to handle the absorption of the incident wave by the surface of the liquid metal and the enthalpy-porosity technique is employed to account for the latent heat during melting and solidification of the material. The maximum cutting speed is defined as the speed for which the calculated cutting profile is just deep enough to cut through the workpiece thickness. It was observed that when the cutting speed is increased high enough for a given laser power level, a maximum cutting speed is reached beyond which the laser power is insufficient to produce complete cutting. The results show that maximum cutting speed increases by rising the laser power and assist gas velocity. The results indicate an intense influence of the laser power on the maximum cutting speed.",

    "abstract": "The density classification problem is one of the simplest yet non-trivial computing tasks which seem to be ideally suitable for cellular automata (CA). Unfortunately, there exists no one-dimensional two-state CA which classifies binary strings according to their densities. If, however, in place of simple cells one uses agents which change their behaviour from one rule to another after a fixed number of iterations, the classification can be performed by the traffic rule 184 and the majority rule 232. This two-rule solution cannot be easily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends on a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting analogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such rule exists. We propose, therefore, to approach this problem form a slightly different angle, namely by introducing a stochastic component into each of the two rules. If one precedes each iteration of rule 184 by the stochastic “lane changing rule”, and each iteration of rule 232 by the stochastic “crowd avoidance” rule, in the limit of infinitely many iterations the classification can be performed correctly with probability 1. This solution can be described either in the language of CA, or using the paradigm of agents which move and proliferate on the 2D lattice, following probabilistic rules.",

An implementation example of AND-NOR PLA (Programmable Logic Array) based on hybrid programmable mDiode gates and volistors in crossbar arrays is described. This PLA circuit reduces both size and delay when compared to other memristive PLAs (mPLAs) realized with stateful gates, CRS (complementary resistive switches) based gates, and Boolean gates.

Firstly, the point cloud data is described as the Octree index structure, and then segmented based on plane fitting. After that, a coarse spatial clustering process based on dual distance is implemented to obtain a set of seed points. Secondly, a triangular irregular network (TIN) is built based on the classic progressive densification method with a set of seed points, and the rest of the valid point clouds are classified iteratively. Finally, the experimental results show that the SCF method in this paper can not only avoids the single threshold restrictions to the filtering result, but also maintains complicated topography when the ground information in the discontinuous terrain is filtered, all of the above are contribute to improve the reliability of the filtering result.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the evaluation of the structural integrity of laser formed steel sheets for possible load carrying applications. The tensile tests conducted revealed 46.000% elongation while the yield strength of the laser formed components were enhanced with about 18.00%. Furthermore, elongated grain structures were observed in the micrographs of the three components formed at the maximum parameter setting. It was revealed that this elongation varied indirectly to the applied line energy. The measured grain sizes further showed that the components formed at the optimized maximum process parameter window were characterized by smaller grain structures with about 60.00% of the grain sizes of the parent material. A progressive increase in the Vickers microhardness of about 40.000% was also observed in the three laser formed components in comparison to the parent material. The analysis of the residual stresses conducted in this study revealed that the changes in the residual stresses are a function of the process condition to which the samples were subjected. In the case of the parent material, the residual stresses across the three measured points were compressive. Similarly, the observed differences in the tensile stresses between the three samples formed at the different parameters can be attributed to the effect of the flow stress, the temperature and the cooling rate. The consistently high value of the stress at a particular point designated as Point 2 can be attributed to the highest temperature recorded at this point, because this is the point where the whole process cycle ends having a high energy density. Looking closely at the stress values captured at the three points, theoretically Point 2 is believed to be the point of maximum deformation; hence, the maximum strain results. At low scan velocity and low temperature, the flow stress associated is high. Therefore, the stress is higher than those at higher velocity. But on the other hand, at high temperatures, the associated flow stress becomes low. It can be summarized that the material characterization and the evaluations conducted on the formed samples revealed the inherent structural integrities.",

We start the system from an initial jammed condition of low density, which shows the same scaling laws previously found [1]. However, for large initial jammed densities, the emergence of spatial variability in the behavior of the cars along the sequence of traffic lights, produce the breakdown of the scaling laws. This spatial disorder corresponds to a different attractor of the system, from that of the small initial jammed densities. As we include velocity perturbations in the dynamics of the cars, all these attractors collapse to a single noisy attractor for all initial jammed densities. However, this emergent state, shows what seems a stochastic resonance in which the average traffic velocity increases with respect to that of the system without noise.",

The performance of such a camera is directly related to its accuracy and credibility of measurement, so it is important to calibrate the photoelectric response characteristics of a scientific grade CCD camera before using it. The traditional system and process used for calibration is complex, involving measurement errors that can adversely affect the accuracy and confidence of calibration. This paper proposes a new method that relies on wedge interference is used images captured by the CCD camera to be calibrated and the calculated laser intensity distribution due to interference to obtain the photoelectric response characteristics of the camera via data processing. This method not only ensures realistic and reliable calibration results but also is simple and fast, providing a basis for obtaining accurate data in ICF experiments.",

The antenna structure was generated by laser ablation of the Cu coating. The goal of the investigation was to find laser parameters which remove the Cu coating at maximum optical transparency of the ablated area and to identify the relationship between laser parameters, designed antenna layout and generated antenna geometry. The findings suggest that the patterning process should be realized at low fluencies in the range of Cu’s ablation threshold in combination with multiple irradiation cycles in order to remove the Cu coating without affecting the glass surface. Increasing the fluence or irradiation cycles increased the ablated area which decreased the width of the generated antenna traces. At the optimized laser parameters, a linear relationship between the designed layout trace width and generated trace width was found. The relationship enabled the production of antenna geometries with high precision which operated at the designed frequency.",

Features were observed oriented perpendicularly to the direction of polarization for linearly polarized light with a period approximately equal to the incident light wavelength. This period was observed to alter with incident angle and a dependency on laser scan direction was also found.

However, there exists a disagreement on whether this phase transition involves the formation of a liquid phase or takes place exclusively in the solid-state. In this work, ELA of amorphous 65Al-23 Cu-12Fe quasi-crystalline (QC) coatings was performed to elucidate the mechanism of the phase transition. Magnetron sputtering was used to deposit 10 to 12 µm thick amorphous QC coatings on steel, aluminum and titanium substrates followed by ELA to convert them into crystalline phases. X-ray diffraction data of ELA samples was used to determine the threshold energy fluence for phase transformation. A two-dimensional, finite-element thermal model was applied to estimate the temperature distributions and melt depth as a function of energy fluence. The effect of ELA on the surface roughness was measured and also used to identify the phase change. Results suggest that ELA caused melting of about a 3 µm layer of the coating at the threshold fluence and more at higher energy fluences. The surface roughness (arithmetic average) was increased from an average of 0.06 µm in as magnetron-sputtered to 0.4 µm in laser-crystallized coatings. It is concluded that the presence of thin molten layer is a necessary and sufficient condition for the phase transition to occur and that the formation of a molten layer roughens the laser-modified surface, a chief drawback of ELA.",

The use of the Fuzzy Linguistic Approach [28] has provided successful results modelling such a type of information. Usually these evaluation processes based on linguistic approaches have used symmetrical and uniformly distributed linguistic term sets in order to model the preferences about the evaluated objects. However, in sensory evaluation is common to find problems whose items or features need to be assessed with assessments in scales that one side of the scale overweight the another one, it means the use of a unbalanced linguistic scale.

Five values of mass energy and line mass are fixed and 35 different experiments have been made and analysed. The results reveal that the mass energy and line mass have an obvious effect on the clad geometry characteristics. The increase of the process parameters increases the clad height, width and depth at low parameter values; however, the clad geometric dimension tends to be kept constant, but decreases at high parameter values. The effects of mass energy and line mass on dilution show the same rules.

Thus, a wide research field evolved around measuring thermal conductivities. Here, we show an implementation of a versatile transient thermoreflectometry technique for measuring thermal conductivity that utilizes a pulsed KrF laser with 248 nm wavelength and 20 ns pulse duration for pumping energy into the surface. Time resolved reflectivity changes from a continuous wave laser at 643 nm are measured using a fast Si-photodiode and an oscilloscope. To optimize this setup, thermoreflectivity properties were studied for different metal transducers as well as optical thicknesses. Since 20 ns are a comparatively long time-scale, the measurements could be fitted to an approximated analytical solution of the heat equation for thermal properties. In this way we could show that the thermal conductivities of different materials can be determined with in most cases sufficiently high accuracy by this relatively simple and flexible technique.",

    "abstract": "Copper is classified as an ideal material for electronic components due to its high electrical conductivity. With society’s increasing interest in alternative energy storage systems, the demand for copper increases and processes for contacting electronic components for battery and fuel cells are gaining in importance. One method to do so is laser microwelding, which is characterized as a high-precision joining process in the micron range. Fibre lasers with a wavelength in the near infrared range (NIR) have established themselves for this purpose. In these joining processes, material properties of copper such as high thermal conductivity and low energy absorption of infrared (IR) radiation cause significant difficulties such as process instabilities as well as pore and spatter formation. Newly developed laser beam sources in the visible wavelength range (VIS) prove to be an alternative to conventional fibre lasers. An increase in absorption of the electromagnetic wave from <5% (1070 nm) to >55% (515 nm) of copper at ambient temperature, leads to higher energy coupling and a more stabilized energy input into the material during the process. In this work the influence of the green wavelength of 515 nm on absorption, energy coupling during the laser welding process and the process dynamics is investigated on Cu-ETP and CuSn6. Blind welds with a frequency doubled 515 nm disc laser are conducted and compared to investigations with a fibre laser at 1070 nm. The reflected radiation from the materials surface is observed by using photodiodes while melt pool dynamics are observed by high speed imaging. The results obtained by the experimental method can be used for the quantitative comparison of laser welding processes as well as for the validation of simulative keyhole and welding models.",

The SLM AlSi10Mg alloy sample showed higher wear resistance at both testing conditions as compared to cast sample owing to the significant enhancement in hardness via microstructural refinement of SLM technology.",

An experimental programme with a series of simple parts has been carried out to establish dimensional accuracy of metal parts made using the three-dimensional (3-D) systems of indirect SLS process. In parallel basic engineering science and experimental has been used to analysed the relative loads experienced by different parts. The experimental data has been used to analyse the level of distortion experienced by parts which undergo infiltration is much less than that of parts which were deliberately not infiltrated; indicating that the early availability of liquid phase is key in avoiding distortion. Analysis has also shown that the propensity for distortion to develop during a sintering or sintering/infiltration step is directly related to the level of stress being experienced by the structure. These two findings show that the application of engineering science to Indirect Metal Laser Sintering could bring parts which are less distorted at the sintering/infiltration stage.",

The speedup of the objective function evaluation is achieved by introducing caching procedure for EML. EML is tested in two separate experiments, the first one is based on 13, and the second on 6 real life instances. The results show that the presented approach outperforms previously introduced EML algorithm and genetic algorithm in 10 out of 13 cases, with respect to the feature reduction rate. The running times are in some cases up to two orders of magnitude shorter. In the second experiment, EML performed better than two variants of particle swarm optimization technique in 3 out of 6 cases.",

We illustrate the main features of our model with two star ranking examples concerning the appointment of a professor among different candidates equipped with disparate qualities, and the selection of the best game from a catalogue. Furthermore, its elementary operations and their implications (like ring sum, product sum, scalar multiplication, different sorts of complements, union, intersection and threshold), are discussed in detail.

    "abstract": "The identification of an optimized model is one of the key issues in the field of fuzzy system modeling. This has gained significant importance since; most of the real life systems are highly complex and nonlinear. Fuzzy model identification involves two stages i.e. identification of input and output membership functions as well as generation of rule base for the system being modeled. The fuzzy modeling or fuzzy model identification can be formulated as a search and optimization problem where the goal is to find the parameters of fuzzy model based on some evaluation criteria such that model gives optimal performance. Therefore, search and optimization techniques can be applied to the problem of model identification. Owing to their ability to deal with highly complex problems nature/biologically inspired approaches are currently amongst the most powerful algorithms suitable for fuzzy model identification problems. The research work reported in this paper is focused on five new approaches to model identification based on nature inspired optimization algorithms namely Biogeography Based Optimization Approach (BBO), Big Bang – Big Crunch Optimization Based Approach (BB-BC), Artificial Bee Colony Optimization Based Approach (ABC), Ant Colony Optimization Based Approach (ACO) and Firefly Algorithm Based Approach (FA). These approaches have been implemented and validated successfully on two standard benchmark data sets to suggest robust, tractable and low cost solutions.",

    "abstract": "The effect of high voltage impulses on the resistance of polymer thick film resistors is studied. The High resistivity materials have resistances in the range of Mega ohms and low resistivity materials have resistances in the range of Kilo ohms. It is found that the resistance decreases in the case of higher resistivity materials and the resistance increases in the case of lower resistivity materials with both the amplitude and duration of the high voltage impulses and with number of impulses. The change in resistance is attributed to the local heating produced in the resistive films when high voltage impulses are applied to polymer thick film resistors. A mechanism has been proposed through which the percentage change in resistance can be estimated in terms of the number of impulses, the duration of the impulses and the length of the impulses. Based on these investigations, we suggest a downward / upward trimming method for polymer thick film resistors through the application of high voltage impulses. This method of trimming is a clean and simple process. It is found that there is a considerable improvement in TCR and current noise of the trimmed resistors with high resistivity and a little degradation in TCR and current noise of the trimmed resistors with lower resistivity. These improvements are attributed to increase in the conductance paths in the trimmed resistors with higher resistivity and breaking of the conductive paths in the trimmed resistors with lower resistivity.",

The normalized intensity distributions at different propagation distances are examined in detail. The influences of refractive index structure constant, beams order, wavelength on the propagation of DHGHs in turbulent atmosphere are also studied. It is found that diffraction effects are more obvious when refractive index structure constant and wavelength became larger or beams order and beams radius became smaller.

But the biggest obstacle is the shortage of proper testing kits which makes life horrendous. As a consequence it demands time to ramp up the development of a suitable test kit. In this scenario we propose a kit that is made up of a two-dimensional (2-D) Si-based photonic crystal structure (PCS) that could distinguish the novel coronaviruses (n-CoV) from ordinary coronaviruses. The principle of identification relies on the reflectance, absorbance and transmittance characteristics at the signal of 412 nm wavelength obtained from a laser diode (LD); moreover, the operational mechanism deals with the manipulation of the signal with the proposed PCS structure which contains the virus solution. Finally, the output transmitted energy differentiates the viruses pertaining to their nature; for example, an output with visible light energy gives an indication of normal flu; on the other hand, output energy within the infrared (IR) range confirms the case of novel coronavirus infection.",

Firstly, we present a general classification model, which combines the question classifier and answer classifier using the surface text. Secondly, we enrich questions by leveraging answer semantic knowledge to tackle the data sparseness. We conducted the experiments using 5-fold cross validation on the corpus of Yahoo!

It is suggested to take the rather unique human cognitive and perceptive experience as evidence that, at least at the level of apperception, quantum jellification does not exist at all. Otherwise the problems of how to characterize the ambivalence of perception and cognition induced by quantum coherence on a fundamental level of cognition, and why this ambivalence appears to be rather weak and can be ignored fapp, remain unsolved.",

This paper focuses on describing and testing a more complex and biologically-authentic AIS model, inspired by the interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Its performance on a realistic process anomaly detection problem is shown to be better than standard AIS methods (negative-selection), policy-based anomaly detection methods (systrace), and an alternative innate AIS approach (the DCA).

An initial algorithm, ESCTDC, uses functional decomposition and multiple-valued logic in order to produce near minimal expressions for these functions. Based on ESCT-DC, an improved algorithm, QuickESCT-DC, is proposed, which outperforms existing algorithms. The experimental results presented indicate the superiority of this algorithm, compared to previous ones for incompletely specified functions, and the exploitation of don’t care terms achieved for ESCT. By setting some limitations in the type of operations performed, our algorithm can minimize ESOP expressions, too.",

A thermal storage medium needs to have high heat capacity and thermal stability at its operating range to store the heat, and the inorganic salt is one of plausible candidates for such application. The salt may also directly transfer the heat to a heat sink in its molten state if the salt has a reasonably low melting point. In addition to the thermal properties, the cost of media is another crucial factor to be considered as it has significant influence on the economic feasibility of the whole thermal storage system. Candidate mineral salts derived from common anion and cation are evaluated based on their properties and costs. A eutectic mixture is suggested after following a screening and evaluation procedure. The selected salt mixture will be applied to a pilot thermal storage system. The results of this study will contribute to elevating the economics and thereby facilitating the commercialization of concentrated solar power systems.",

Recursive estimation of neighbors (REN), which distinguishes the perception area of each cell from the CA rule neighborhood, has recently been used in order to develop CA. This framework allows the construction of nonuniform CAs that are composed of cells with perception area sizes, which can be interpreted as an individual attribute of each cell. Focusing primarily on a one-dimensional (1D) elementary CA, fractal CAs composed of self-similarly arranged cells have been proposed and their characteristics have been investigated. In this paper, 2D fractal CAs are defined and implemented for use in outer-totalistic rules. Moreover, fractal CAs derived from multi-state linear rules are also presented. These CAs inherit the features of the linear rules, including replicability and time reversibility, which indicate their applicability to a wide variety of fields.",

Microstructure of the surface clad layer consists of acicular a’ -phase and the microstructure of the interface consists of equiaxed grains of a-phase and white precipitates of FeTi intermetallic phase at the grain boundaries. The average microhardness of the clad zone and the interface increases to 240 and 531 VHN, respectively as compared to 220 VHN for as-received AISI 316L stainless steel. Fretting wear behaviour against hardened steel ball showed a marginal improvement in fretting wear resistance due to laser surface cladding. On the other hand, the wear resistance of the interface increases significantly. An improvement in corrosion resistance with improved bio-activity is also noticed due to laser surface cladding.",

However, reliable biomedical imaging requires a thorough analysis of these endogenous signals. Looking at skin biopsies, we focused on 2-Photon Excited Fluorescence (2PEF) arising from cytokeratins in the epidermis, and second harmonic generation (SHG) from collagen fibers in the dermis. We determined the 2PEF excitation spectrum and action cross section of purified keratins from human epidermis, and obtained a good agreement with in situ measurements. In order to analyze the role of chirality and collagen type in SHG signal, we performed polarization-resolved surface SHG experiments on thin films of collagens I and IV molecules. We observed that collagen I and IV molecules exhibit comparable SHG signals, except for the chiral contributions which are absent for collagen IV and represent typically 50% of the signal for collagen I. We concluded that the large collagen I SHG efficiency is dominated by coherent effects due to the high density and quasi-crystalline order in collagen fibrils, whereas the lack of any alignment within the collagen IV molecules explains the absence of signal from this collagen type in SHG microscopy.",

In the model, the complication produced by the moving boundaries of solid/liquid and gas/liquid was successfully resolved by using the ‘Volume of Fluid (VOF)/Continuum Surface Force (CSF)’capability of ANSYS.

While the online markets have recently received a tremendous amount of attention, the E-business challenge concerns a much broader constituency. Hence, in this paper, Hybridized Computational Predictive Framework (HCPF) has been proposed to analyze the E-business transformation for organizational management and its impact on the online market. A new job definition and revised policies are necessary to introduce e-business application re-design, organizational transformation, and alignment. In addition, taxation, legal, and security considerations will be addressed by organizations. All the rules and models change the E-business. Adopting new technologies and business models in an enterprise is essential to increasing the organization’s productivity. The Internet economy needs an essential change in the participating organizations. By digitizing the whole supply chain, e-business and the online market’s real benefits can be achieved. The experimental results show that the proposed HCPF method achieves high accuracy of 93.6%, F-measure of 93.2%, less error rate of 1.2%, duration of 7.6%, perception of 94.2%, low cost of 24%, compared to other existing methods.",

The joints of the porous alloy are preferentially fractured, and the Si content at the bottom position of the dimple is higher than the dimple edge. During the compression process of the porous AlSi10Mg alloy, the stress and strain distribution at the joint are concentrated, resulting in joint fracture. The inherent elasticity, shear stress and forced contact of supporting plates or chips are the causes of these compression stages. The distribution of Si element in the fracture is caused by the dimples that are easily formed at the α-Al/Si interface, eventually resulting in the Si content at the bottom of the dimple being higher than the dimple edge.",

In this article support vector regression (SVR) was applied for the shaped surface parameters prediction. The SVR model was compared with other computational intelligence models like artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic programming (GP) techniques as benchmark models. Laser power, laser scan speed and spot diameter were used as inputs. The crucial aim of the study was to predict favourable and unfavourable shape forms according to the machining parameters. By the way one should make optimal machining conditions in order to avoid unfavourable shape forms. Based on the results, SVR model outperformed ANN and GP models for the shaped surface parameters prediction.",

    "abstract": "One of the strategic factors in supply chain management is supplier reliability. In particular, the success of the construction project highly depends on the performances of the suppliers since their performance affect quality and cost of any project. Therefore, the reliability of supplier has critical impact on construction project. In the literature, there are dozens of studies that use different models on evaluation of suppliers’ performance. Only a few of these studies, however, consider supplier’s reliability as a parameter although there are multiple parameters representing the reliability of suppliers. Suppliers’ reliability problem should be considered in terms of many factors by leading to a large set of subjective data. In this study, we aim at determining factors which play important role on the reliability of suppliers and analyze the importance degrees of these factors for construction industry. Furthermore, how reliability of a supplier can be measured under the determined factors is illustrated. Prioritizing reliability factors and measuring supplier reliability are hard and complex problems since their solutions are based on subjective and imprecise data sets including uncertainties. For this purpose, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarch Process (FAHP) method is used to prioritize supplier reliability factors while a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is used in order to reveal reliability of suppliers’ performances.",

The numerical model is validated by comparing the surface temperature with the experiments. The surface temperature obtained from the developed numerical model having volumetric and surface heat flux are compared with the surface heat flux model.

The drilled hole quality in terms of hole taper, and circularity at top and bottom sides have been considered for multi-criteria optimization. Authors have applied a new hybrid approach of modelling and multi-objective optimization of hole geometry in laser trepan drilling of difficult to cut Ti-alloy. The hole quality comprising taper and circularities are represented by a common performance index in mathematical form using artificial neural network modelling coupled with grey-entropy measurement technique. Optimization of the performance index function using genetic algorithms show considerable improvements in hole quality.

Polyethyleneoxide, as a flexible polymer, and hydroxypropyl cellulose, as a rigid rod-like polymer, were added to the two-dimensional turbulence that was visualized by the interference pattern of flowing soap films and were analyzed using a novel single-image analysis. The distributions of the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence were calculated by the curvatures of the interference patterns. The distribution became narrower by the addition of polymers. The power spectra of interference images were also obtained, which is related to fluctuations of the water layer in turbulence. The power spectra exhibit a scaling behavior, and the power components give information on the energy transfer in turbulence. The results indicated that the mechanisms of energy transfer are different in the streamwise and normal directions, which is related to the flexibility and extensional viscosity of the polymers.",

The high price of precious metals stimulated the use of metal oxide catalyst and particularly the catalysts based on manganese oxide.

In this present work hot corrosion experiments were performed on the selective laser melted sample and as received sample in laboratory air and NaCl environment at 600oC for 50 cycles. The parabolic rate constants were calculated for different environments from the thermogravimetric data obtained for the samples and they show that corrosion rate is minimum in laboratory air and maximum for SLM sample in NaCl environment due to the presence of gaseous chlorides. The microstructure morphologies and the oxide scales formed upon hot corrosion was characterized by optical and scanning electron microscope (SEM) while the constituents were determined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis to understand the corrosion mechanisms.

In PSNQ P systems, the spikes of a neuron are requested from neighboring neurons, depending on both the contents and polarization of the neuron and the polarization of all requesting neurons (not checked by means of a regular expression). Meanwhile, the polarizations related to the requesting neurons can be exchanged. Moreover, PSNQ P systems are proved to be computationally universal as long as one type of spike is considered, and a small universal PSNQ P system using 209 neurons is constructed.",

The Ni-based super alloy CMSX-4 Plus (SLS) was investigated and a model was developed to predict the dynamic loss of mass with time and track the potential for composition shifts throughout each thermal cycle based on the Langmuir’s equation for ideal solution behavior. Results were verified by post-test chemical analysis of key elemental constituents including Al, Cr, Ti, and Co where the error in composition for each element was less than 1% when the activity of aluminum in solution was fixed at zero – effectively eliminating evaporation of aluminum for ground-based electrostatic levitation (ESL) testing in vacuum. This model predicts the mass evaporation for Al and Co within ±6 % errors for CMSX-4 plus samples processed in ESL. Application of this technique to the space tests using the ESA ISS-EML facility shows that by conducting experiments in an inert shielding-gas environment, composition shifts due to differential relative evaporation become negligible and the composition is maintained within the desired limits. By tracking overall mass loss during testing the influence of evaporation on density measurements is discussed.",

Refractive index of surrounded matrix polymer was controlled to match the ordinary or extraordinary index of aligned fibers whereas a large mismatch of refractive index was simultaneously generated in the opposite direction. Thus, obtained film possesses good polarized property with transparency or opaque which depends on the polarized direction of incident light. The scattering light from parallel-aligned fibers becomes anisotropic, and scattering direction depends on the aligned fibrous direction. Polarization degree of Nylon 6 fibers/polymer composites is found to be 87% whereas that of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers/polymer composites which have larger birefringence than that of Nylon 6, reached above 97%. S-polarized or p-polarized scattered light was obtained by matching the refractive index to ordinary or extraordinary index of fiber, respectively. These optical films would be promising candidates as a novel polarizer and light diffuser.",

It remains challenging in organizational and institutional data management.

Doping of PC with light absorbing particles and use of laser source with high repetition rate are commonly practice method for laser processing of transparent material. Alternatively, laser-induced incubation can be another technique for laser processing of transparent PC.

The work attempt on gaining fundamental insight into the effect of nanosecond Nd:YAG laser irradiation of transparent PC. The findings suggest that there is no presence of thermal accumulation in between the laser pulses during nanosecond pulse laser irradiation of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser on transparent PC.

The results show that the transformation of the residual stress state and the surface hardness state can be attributed to the phase-transformation-induced microstructure change. The noticeable sink mark is produced at the Nd:YAG pulsed laser induced thermal damage area owing to the combined effect between the high energy pulsed laser and the surface tensile residual stress field.

Macroscopically, the study focuses on the emergence of qualitative attributes of crowd behaviour, such as collective effects, random to coherent motion due to a common purpose and transition to incoordination (arching) due to clogging. Microscopically, all configurations of the CA model are triggered by simple rules applied locally to each of the group members.

Likewise, porosity formation during the laser surface treatment of ceramics presents a problematic subject. Any analysis, therefore, of these issues would be most informative. It is widely accepted that to prevent cracking in ceramics during laser surface treatment some form of pre- and post-treatment heating must take place. This study examines the formation of cracks and porosities during the CO2 laser surface treatment of a magnesia partially stabilized zirconia (MgO-PSZ) ceramic when pre-treatment heating was applied externally and post treatment heating was achieved using firstly a plain diverging beam, and secondly using a diffractive optical element (DOE) to produce a “tailored” laser beam profile. The results of this study revealed that the pre-treatment heating regime and the laser beam profile played a vital role in determining the occurrence, number and scale of microcracks and porosities in the CO2 laser surface treated MgO-PSZ.",

In this paper, we propose an automatic design approach for SN P systems by genetic algorithms. More specifically, the regular expressions are changed to achieve the automatic design of SN P systems. In this method, the number of neurons in system, the synapse connections between neurons, the number of rules within each neuron and the number of spikes within each neuron are known. A population of SN P systems is created by generating randomly accepted regular expressions. A genetic algorithm is applied to evolve a population of SN P systems toward a successful SN P systems with high accuracy and sensitivity for carrying out specific task. An effective fitness function is designed to evaluate each candidate SN P system. In addition, the elitism, crossover and mutation are also designed. Finally, experimental results show that the approach can successfully accomplish the automatic design of SN P systems for generating natural numbers and even natural numbers by using the .NET framework.",

The plasma was generated using a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser emitting a 10 ns pulse at a wavelength of 1064 nm to irradiate the surface of an AlZnO film in air at atmospheric pressure. The plasma emission spectroscopy was detected with linear charge-coupled device (CCD) array through a bundle of seven optical fibres, each with a diameter of around 600 μm. After calculating the temperature of excited plasma we found that it could be divided into two regions depending upon the pulse energy.

In particular, man-made structures 3-D spatial information extraction methodology is one of the major fields of application of terrestrial laser scanning technology. In this paper, an automated and efficient method for extracting highway tunnel lining cross-sections using terrestrial 3-D laser scanning system is presented. First, the tunnel point cloud acquired from terrestrial laser scanner is registered based on the control network (CN) method and least-squares optimization, ensures minimization of the target-to-target registration errors. Then the 3-D tunnel point cloud is projected onto a horizon plane, converted to a two-dimensional (2-D) planar image, and skeletonized to estimate the tunnel 3-D centreline. The orientation of tunnel cross-section, which are orthogonal to the centreline, is defined to be in terms of the centreline. Finally, the cross-sectional planes are determined for every interval. The proposed method was implemented on concrete highway tunnel monitoring project on the G25 highway, in Jiangsu Province, China, and proved itself to offer advantages, including detailed description and improved surveying automations and data processing efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "The mass produced single nut ball screw pair taken as the research object for an antifriction method by using ultrasonic vibration to reduce the friction of ball screw pair is proposed. A piezoelectric (PZT) vibrator is connected on the nut to form the antifriction vibrator. By exciting the PZT ceramics in the PZT vibrator, the vibration modal of the antifriction vibrator is excited. The ultrasonic vibration velocity is generated between the ball raceway contact pair and the ultrasonic vibration antifriction is realized. The modal analysis of the antifriction vibrator was carried out by using the finite element method (FEM). The second-order torsional vibration modal was determined as the working modal and the size of the main structure for this modal was determined. The sample was manufactured, and the resonance frequency and vibration modal of the antifriction vibrator were measured by an ingenious method with laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The test results show that the second-order torsional vibration of the antifriction vibrator can be excited when the frequency is 31 kHz. This is consistent with the simulation results. The ultrasonic vibration antifriction system of ball screw pair was established. The unloaded antifriction performance experiment of the antifriction system was carried out. The average friction reduction percentage can reach 7.87%. The result shows that the antifriction vibrator can effectively reduce the friction of ball screw pair. Since there is no need to change the structure of the mass-produced ball screw pair and lower power consumption, the method proposed in this paper has a certain commercial prospect.",

The second direction of these studies is connected with high speed switching of the liquid crystal mesophase doped with fullerene-containing charge-transfer complexes. The effect of liquid crystal dipoles reorientation in microsecond range has been shown in TN and IPS constructions of the electro-optical liquid crystal cells. Some mechanisms of surface hardness improvement and speed switching process initiated with nanoobjects are postulated. The data presented in the current study testify that these nano-objects-containing materials could be used as new transparent aerospace elements and new laser window for the UV and IR spectral range, as well as new optical high-speed switches and spatial light modulators for a broad spectral range.",

As the driving component, the bandwidth of the piezoelectric (PZT) scanner mainly affects the scanning speed and the scanning range. The commonly used triangular waveform contains many higher order Fourier components, easily inducing resonance of the PZT scanner; therefore, the conventional scanning method limits the scanning speed to a small range. In the article, the sinusoidal scanning method combined with the equal displacement correction method is put forward to improve the scanning speed of the AFM. Specifically, the PZT scanner is driven by a sinusoidal waveform in the fast axis and a triangular waveform in the slow axis, allowing the scanner to move at high speeds and large ranges without exciting its mechanical resonance. Moreover, the image transformation induced by the non-linearity of the sinusoidal waveform can be eliminated by the implementation of the equal displacement correction method, leading to a highly accurate lateral positioning for the AFM. Experimental results indicate that high quality images can be generated at a high scanning rate with the new scanning method, compared with the conventional triangular scanning method and the cantilever’s scanning speed can reach 1.5 mm/s.",

Multiple quality characteristics have been optimized using grey based Taguchi technique.

Microhardness was measured at the laser treated surface and residual stress formed in the laser treated layer was determined from X-ray diffractograms.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new global optimization approach named three-parent genetic algorithm. The algorithm is inspired by the three-parent biological process that has been successfully employed in the field of genetics by the doctors to get rid of mitochondrial diseases which otherwise the offspring would have suffered. Thus, making three-parent children, healthier than the normal two-parent children. In the three-parent concept, the cell body with defective mitochondria of original mother is separated from nucleus and the cell body is destroyed. The separated nucleus is placed in the donors denucleared cell body containing healthy mitochondria. Thereafter the egg is fertilized. The process was observed to produce fitter offspring. We conceptualized this algorithm based upon the 3-parent genetic process. We implemented the algorithm in MATLAB, tested it on the CEC-2014 test bench and compared the performance with 16 other algorithms. The proposed algorithm outperformed all other algorithms on 7 test functions. None of the other algorithms could match this performance. In addition for functions f3 and f8 of CEC-2014 it gave the best performance but this performance was equaled by few other algorithms also. In total the proposed algorithm gave best performance on 9 functions. Further, the paper proposes a 3PGA based new dynamic optimal cost path evaluation approach in WMNs. The approach was implemented in MATLAB and the performance was compared with 8 other approaches. In this application also the proposed approach gave best performance of all the approaches for WMNs of size greater than 1000 nodes.",

A potential technical hurdle in the form bubbling has been witnessed and described. Bubbling prevented contact between the two laminates and impinged upon the viability of the bonds produced; film handling improvement is recommended as a solution. The Gaussian profile of the laser in concert with the circular laser spot shape and the traverse strategy of the scans used caused the centre of the bond to be over irradiated whilst the edge was under-irradiated. This had several affects: it limited the area over which an effective bond was achieved; caused delamination of the film at the track edges and locally modified the polypropylene structure. A highly consistent and repeatable mean peel resistance force of 1.09 N was achieved using the laser activated adhesive bonding technique described. Little bond strength dependency upon laser irradiance was observed, which allied with the results of other work, leads to the proposal that the adhesive has a very broad laser irradiance operating range.",

The performance of this R-FOG system is experimentally studied. A gyro bias stability of 7.30 deg/h is achieved and a ±36.00 deg/h rotation response is observed. And either of the bias stability or rotation response is of the same magnitude as that of the closed-loop R-FOG system using fibre laser. As a result of the closed-loop operation, the dynamic range is increased to ±860.00 deg/s, which is four-times that of the open-loop system, and the scale factor nonlinearity is decreased to 770 ppm from 2.670% under open-loop operation. It is concluded that besides greatly minimizing system size, the performance of the system using a semiconductor laser is very close to that using a fibre laser, and compared with the open-loop operation, the closed-loop operation system with a semiconductor laser can also greatly improve the linearity and dynamic range.

    "abstract": "In statistics viewpoint, it is impossible to precisely estimate a probability distribution of a population with a sample whose size is less than the population’s size. In general, with histogram method, estimates resulted from different samples are different, whose cover would reflect the scattering of estimates. Meanwhile, a fuzzy probability distribution would reflect the fuzziness of the probability estimate. According to the consistency principle of possibility/probability, we infer that the model used for calculating fuzzy probabilities is reliable if the fuzzy probability distribution is consist with the cover of histograms, which is a class of probability distributions of the probabilities that the event occurs in intervals. In this paper, with simulation results, we verify that the interior-outer-set model is basically reliable.",

    "abstract": "The Thomas Kuhn Reich sum rules and the sum-over-states (SOS) expression for the hyperpolarizabilities are truncated when calculating the fundamental limits of nonlinear susceptibilities. Truncation of the SOS expression can lead to an accurate approximation of the first and second hyperpolarizabilities due to energy denominators, which can make the truncated series converge to within 10% of the full series after only a few excited states are included in the sum. The terms in the sum rule series, however, are weighted by the state energies, so convergence of the series requires that the position matrix elements scale at most in inverse proportion to the square root of the energy. Even if the convergence condition is met, serious pathologies arise, including self inconsistent sum rules and equations that contradict reality. As a result, using the truncated sum rules alone leads to pathologies that make any rigorous calculations impossible, let alone yielding even good approximations. This paper discusses conditions under which pathologies can be swept under the rug and how the theory of limits, when properly culled and extrapolated using heuristic arguments, can lead to a semi-rigorous theory that successfully predicts the behavior of all known quantum systems, both when tested against exact calculations or measurements of broad classes of molecules.",

A commercial finite element analysis (FEA) code (ABAQUS) was used to directly solve and model the temperature distribution on the surface of the stainless steel during semiconductor laser heating in distilled water. The experimental results confirmed the simulation trend.

The technique was tested on the mainboard of a personal commercialised computer. Whereas, it may be used in characterization of the heat transfer on the electronic cards that are included in desktops and laptops computers, telecommunications servers, automotive and aerospace engines. The convective heat transfer coefficient was evaluated between the main microprocessor and the air-flow in the direction parallel to the printed board. The evaluation method consists of analysing the transient temperature of the microprocessor after a sudden energy pulse with a fixed duration given by two lamps. For the validation of the method, two cooling configurations were tested and evaluated. The first one considers the air-flow in the lengthwise of the main wiring board, and the second one concerns the case where the flow is along the widthways. In each configuration, the heat transfer coefficient was evaluated for three flow velocities.",

In a secure communication system, wherein a data is sent in a partially hidden form, or in a problem like identification of palimpsests, we come across the challenge of finding partially hidden data. The proposed approach exploits techniques like evolutionary algorithm and particle swarm optimization. In both these approaches, a random population of solutions is extracted from the occluded data and by subjecting them to the genetic operators or the rules defined by the swarm intelligence, the partially hidden data is found out after certain number of generations. The number of generations required for identifying the hidden data and the probability of success depend on the amount of occlusion. The techniques work well even if up to 90% of the data is hidden. A comparison of performance both methods has been carried out and it is found that the proposed techniques give good results in terms of probability of success and accuracy of identification, though there is some compromise required on time required for arriving at the results.",

At the micro-scale, viscous diffusion dominates and the Reynolds number for typical processes is of order 1. A numerical fluid-and-solid interaction model is developed using the fictitious domain method. Distributed Lagrange Multipliers are used to couple the fluid and solid equations. Fluid flow is generated by the actuation of flexible flaps using an applied surface load. The influence of the modulus of elasticity and the wall endpoint condition on fluid mixing for both single and multiple flaps is considered. Mixing in the fluid is determined by solving the mass transport equation for a solute and calculating a mixing fraction. The results show that for single flap motion, flap effectiveness changes with the applied load. The results of multiple flap motion show that single flaps are equally effective in enhancing fluid mixing as multiple flaps since an additional flap can act as a barrier to fluid recirculation. An additional flap can enhance mixing if the flaps oscillate out of phase with a phase angle of φ = 0 or in some cases φ = π/2.",

    "abstract": "We report on development of photorefractive materials with superior performance. High-voltage (5-10 kV) poling necessary for the operation of photorefractive polymeric devices has been a drawback of these materials. We have now developed devices that can be poled at order of magnitude lower voltages by carefully engineering the material composition using high performance nonlinear chromophores for thinner devices. For a thickness of 20 µm, the device showed more than 90% diffraction efficiency with a dominant fast response time of 27 ms at about an applied voltage of 1 kV. A useful diffraction efficiency of about 10% can be observed even at a voltage as little as 450 V, which demonstrates a major step forward in the possible applications of photorefractive devices. We have also been able to extend the operating wavelength to near IR. By employing a new sensitizer dye, we have demonstrated a first-time proof of photorefractivity at 975 nm in an all-organic composite with 90% diffraction efficiency and video rate response time using a low power cw laser. This is a significant advance in the development of all-organic PR device for near-infrared imaging and optical communication. Furthermore, devices were made to operate at 1550 nm wavelength, suitable for fiber optics applications. Using two-photon absorption (TPA) processes, we demonstrated more than 40% diffraction efficiency maintaining near video-rate response time. This approach provides the inherent advantage of non-destructive read-out using cw laser light. As an application of these devices, we demonstrated beam cleanup and aberration correction in a free space communication application. An oil-filled phase plate, which generates atmospheric-like wavefront aberrations, was employed and demonstrated high quality aberration corrections.",

For economical and technical reasons application of cellular automata as computer architecture requires the use of partitions that are assembled into larger units, similar to memory in current systems (memory chips, Dual-In-line Memory Modules, etc.). This requires the exchange of the cell state at the chip boundaries. In this paper we consider the analysis of the required bandwidth over a chip boundary when a one-way protocol is used. The analysis algorithm counts the number of equivalence classes with respect to the cell states on the sending side. When the states along the chip boundary are combined, a closed form solution for the number of equivalence classes is derived. The algorithm can be implemented using Binary Decision Diagrams, and we give results for several example cellular automata.",

The results show that the larger tensile residual stress induced by the high energy laser can be effectively relieved by the ultrasonic stress relief. In addition, the effect of the ultrasonic stress relief can be improved by increasing the ultrasonic vibration energy imposed into the TC4 titanium alloy. The findings confirm that the ultrasonic stress relief is promising to be used to relieve the residual stress in TC4 titanium alloy during the processing and manufacturing process.",

The assessment of training performed in this kind of system is necessary to assess the training quality and provide some feedback about the user performance. Because VR simulators are real-time systems, on-line assessment tools attached to them must have a low complexity algorithm to not compromise the performance of the simulators. This work presents a new approach to online assessment using a tool based on Fuzzy Bayes Rule for modeling and classification of simulation in pre-defined classes of training. This method allows the use of continuous variables without loss of information. It also solves the problem of low complexity in on-line assessments without compromise performance of the simulator. Results of its application are provided and compared with another assessment system based on classical Bayes rule.",

Bistable photochromic molecules embedded in various matrices are responsible for photoinduced anisotropy in photochromic materials but also in bacteriorhodopsin. However, mechanisms leading to the appearance of substantial light induced birefringence or dichroism are different. In liquid crystals molecular reorientations originate from interaction of molecules with light induced electric field changes, in photorefractive polymers are partially due to linear electrooptic effect and in photochromic polymers molecules undergo conformational changes due to photoisomerisation. In any case, we deal with near resonance optical linear or nonlinear processes mediated frequently by environment. The characteristic features underlying these phenomena, studied by optical wave-mixing techniques, will be presented and discussed. Comparative studies of diffraction grating inscription using continuos and pulsed laser light illumination and employing polarisation and moving gratings experiments in different types of materials allowed us to observe differences and similarities between various processes.",

After the temperature cycling tests, capacitors were tested for their breakdown voltage, so that voltage was slowly increased from 0V to 93V, provided no failure occurred. According to results of this research, a change in the upper temperature in a temperature cycling test does not affect the breakdown voltage of tantalum capacitors, whereas adding voltage to temperature cycling test can in some cases cause more failures.

An effective nano-photonic coupling mechanism has been demonstrated and a sub-wavelength propagation regime obtained between four perpendicular organic rib tapers and two parallel waveguides with respectively curved and straight silica nano-ridges configurations. The specific silica nano-ridge-waveguides structures show off optical propagation losses ranging between 37 and 68 dB/mm at visible and infra-red wavelengths respectively. Such flexible devices offer a versatile fabrication process and present great potential regarding future applications for shaping nano-connections and integrating high-density networks.

The surface structure which is formed is regular: it is an array of submicron size hexagons when illumination beam has linear polarization. The saturated modulation depth is in the 100 nm range, independent of the power of the illumination beam. The phenomenon is rather universal as it is observed for several azo-polymer materials, illuminated at different wavelengths and under different conditions, as long as illumination is normal to the surface. When the phenomenon is set, incident light is strongly diffracted into the plane of the film. Calculation shows that the surface structure corresponds to optimum coupling of the incident light into the plane of the film: the surface self-organises into a holographic notch-filter structure. The reason is that azo-benzene molecules move under resonant excitation following their reversible trans-cis isomery. They move endlessly until they fall into a darker region. In the absence of any dark region, they create a diffraction structure which optimizes dissipation of the light. When the diffraction structure is set, the process crystallises.",

Microhardness, drysliding wear and electrochemical polarization tests were used to study the hardness, wear and corrosion resistance of these modified surfaces and followed by microstructure, phase composition analysis. The conventional, AZ91D/EN/LST samples produced a relatively smooth, crack-free and hard layer consisting of Ni-Mg intermetallic particles; thereby offered a significant increase in hardness and wear resistance and shortcoming of this method is its significant decrease in corrosion resistance, due to the diffusion of Mg into re-melted layer and the formation of Ni-Mg intermetallic phases. On the other hand, this proposed method AZ91D/LST/EN samples produced an increase in surface hardness and wear resistance and maintains a similar and high corrosion resistance.",

Obtaining the Mueller matrix provides at the same time all the polarimetric properties of the sample as its diattenuation, dichroism, retardence, birefringence and depolarization. These quantities could be of major importance for studying pathologies that involve a change of structure. The optical polarization properties in cancerous samples tend to increase because the cancerous region is more rigid than the normal surrounding areas. This would subsequently appear as differences in the distribution of internal birefringence that could be used to improve image contrast between the cancerous and normal tissue structures. The depolarizing ability of these images indicates that blood is a highly depolarizing material. The essential feature of the Stokes–Mueller formalism that is used extensively in this research is summarized. It is well known that intercellular changes occur between normal versus cancerous cells: the transmittance of light through a normal blood sample is higher, retardence, depolarization and polarizance are lower when compared to a malignant blood sample. This study would prove useful as an early diagnostic tool for detecting blood malignancy.",

In this paper, a Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) based software maintainability prediction model, which combines the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Fuzzy Logic (FL), is proposed. To overcome the innate flaws of FNN, a statistical technique, e.g. Principle Component Analysis (PCA), is also used for the sake of computational simplicity. The proposed FNN, reinforced by PCA, can effectively reflect the complex relations among independent and dependable variables, that is, by showing relatively high prediction accuracy. The empirical experimental results verify this claim in the sense that, with respect to two disparate object-oriented software data sets, the model built by the proposed method prevails against three other typical counterparts, Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR), ANN and Support Vector Regression (SVR), in terms of the prediction accuracy.",

This applies to both the construction of the built environment and resource consumption during its occupation and use. Where incremental improvements to current practices can be realised, the net benefits are often far outstripped by the burgeoning demands of rapidly increasing population growth and urbanisation. Against the backdrop of this grand societal challenge, it is necessary to explore approaches that envision a paradigm shift in how material is sourced, processed and assembled to address the magnitude of these challenges in a truly sustainable way, and which can even provide added value. We propose to develop a structural substrate by using live fungal mycelium, functionalise the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers to make mycelium-based electronics, implement sensorial fusion and decision making in the fungal electronics and to grow monolithic buildings from the functionalised fungal substrate. Fungal buildings will self-grow, build, and repair themselves subject to substrate supplied, use natural adaptation to the environment, sense all that humans can sense.",

In this paper, we propose a simple and easy alignment calibration method, which only needs one additional position besides the initial position. Nevertheless, the DVL-aided INS initial alignment is still a challenge, as it impacts the accuracy of the proposed calibration method. Therefore, an attitude backtracking technique that can improve the calibration robustness is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to eliminate the effects of the INS initial alignment and hence yield reliable calibration results.",

The combination of 750 W laser power, 10 m/s scanning speed and 1 r/min feeding rare is selected as the desirable process parameters.

A scaled model of a conventional medium sized bridge (length of 50 meters, height of 10 meters, and with 2 piers) was examined for the purpose of this study. This method includes installing two sensor nodes with the ability of measuring temperature and humidity on both side of the scaled model of a conventional bridge. The data collected by the system including temperature and humidity values are received by a LABVIEW-based software to be analyzed and stored in a database. Proposed SHM monitoring system is equipped by a novel method of using data mining techniques on the database of climatic conditions of past few years related to the location of the bridge to predict the occurrence and severity of future damages. In addition, this system has several alarm levels which are based on analysis of bridge conditions with fuzzy inference methods, so it can issue proactive and precise alarms regarding to the position of the occurrence of possible damages and the severity of them in the bridge deck to ensure total proactive maintenance (TPM). Very low costs, increased efficiency of the bridge service, and reduced maintenance costs makes this SHM system a practical and applicable system. The data and results related to all mentioned subjects were thoroughly discussed and the accuracy and reliability of the SHM systems has been evaluated. The results show that this system is qualified to be used as a SHM system in medium size to large size bridges.",

In (i) and (ii) moderate bias voltages induce a phase change in the monolayer which almost suppress the luminescence yields. A conjugated polymer coverage in (iii) plays a protective role for bias voltages below its optical band-gap, ~2.2 V. Above this value, the PPV layer itself is degraded, which prevents the excitation by STM of the PPV core luminescence.",

The Sagnac filtering mirror consists of a polarization maintaining directional coupler and two lengths of polarization maintaining fibers. The lasing wavelength and channel number are determined by properly adjusting the polarization controller within the unidirectional ring cavity and are both very stable. The tunable chirped fiber grating, which acts as a continuous time-delay element, is achieved by bending a uniform fiber Bragg grating bonded at a slant onto the lateral surface of a simply supported beam. By adjusting the chirp rate of the fiber grating via the bend strain, this type of tunable chirped fiber grating can achieve very low and adjustable delay times and therefore provides higher angle resolution for scanning microwave beams. The true-time-delay system using the proposed tunable chirped fiber grating delay element and multi-wavelength fiber ring laser has been constructed and demonstrated experimentally.",

In order to ensure that the heat flux transmits within the sample and is not affected by the heat loss at the sample boundary, its boundary is usually set as an adiabatic boundary. Nevertheless, it will lead to the accumulation of heat. In order to achieve the hot wire method conveniently, solid material for which a thinner thickness can be measured and the effective test time of the experiment is flexible. By so doing, we improved the traditional parallel hot wire method. The temperature measuring points were arranged along the thickness direction of the sample instead of parallel to the hot wire, and the enantiomorphous heat-source theory was introduced to modify the effect of heat accumulation on the temperature rise of the sample. The thermophysical property of diatomite refractory brick, asbestos board and marble were measured. The results show that the revised calculated values are in good agreement with the existing test values, with a maximum error of 5%, effectively expanding the application range of the hot wire method.",

Coupling of ultrasound with liquid medium produces acoustic cavitation and acoustic streaming. These two events are responsible for all physicochemical transformations taking place within an ultrasonic system. The effect of storage pressure on destratification with the application of ultrasonics was studied experimentally. Increase in storage pressure shows contrasting effects at low and high frequency of applied acoustic field. Destratification is faster at higher storage pressures for low frequency ultrasonics; at high frequency of ultrasound, the process is slowed down because of suppression of acoustic streaming. Enhancement of cavitation is the reason for better destratification at low frequency of ultrasound and high storage pressure. Increase in power amplitude of ultrasound results in enhancement of destratification at all frequencies. The ability of high frequency ultrasonics to produce more acoustic streaming effects makes them highly suitable for destratification in tall containers; however, under pressurized conditions, dual-frequency mode, which combines one low frequency with a second higher frequency, is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Laser transmission welding (LTW) is widely recognized as an effective joining method for thermoplastic polymers. Excellent mechanical, physical and thermal properties of polypropylene makes it suitable for many application in aerospace, automotive manufacturing and laboratory accessories; however, joining of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers is very difficult due to their poor compatibility or different crystal structure. To overcome this problem, white ink is applied at the interface of weld to increase the solubility and retain the laser heat input. As white ink is an opaque, containing copolymer resins which helps to enhance the bonding strength. Here, acrylic (amorphous) and polypropylene copolymer (PPCP) (semi-crystalline) each of 4 mm thickness have been joined by low power diode laser. Experimental analysis of the effect of process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed and pulse frequency on the weld zone has been studied. Greater weld strength is achieved at low scan speed. A novel multi objective snap drift cuckoo search (SDCS) optimization technique has been implemented for betterment of weld strength and weld width. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used to observe the welded zone morphology. It is observed that weld strength is primarily dependent on mechanical interlocking between the two layers of polymers.",

The results showed that the new method could successfully make a coating layer on the substrate. The coating layer not only covered the substrate surface but also embedded in the substrate.

The photochromic additive undergoes a reversible ring-opening reaction resulting in a significant increase of its dipole moment. Due to charge-dipole interactions, dipolar traps are formed on the polymer chain in the vicinity of dispersed polar species. The charge carrier trap formation was checked by photocurrent kinetics measurements. At the same time the capacitance of the system was found to increase due to the formation of dipolar species. The calculations show that the presence of dipolar species in the vicinity of an MEH-PPV chain modifies the on-chain site energies and consequently increases of the width of distribution of hopping transport states. The influence of various levels of energetic disorder of chain hopping states on the charge carrier mobility was described by means of the tight–binding approximation model. It was shown that the increasing disorder destroys the resonance between charge carrier energies on adjacent sites, and therefore limits the diffusive charge carrier motion. Thus, the transport properties of a polymer chain can be reversibly changed by a photochromic reaction of the additive.",

The results show that the residual stress in the small workpieces can be eliminated by the high frequency VSR; moreover, increasing the external high frequency vibration energy imposed into the workpieces can improve the effect of the high frequency VSR.

The results show that the reflected beam at the return place changes from a leptokurtic beam into a mesokurtic beam along with the increase of the incident angle.

The developed monitoring device is compact and able to detect both small (cracks, for example) and large defects (opacity, for example) on the surface of the protective slide.

    "abstract": "Statistical process control (SPC) that generally relies on the use of control charts (CCs) to monitor a manufacturing process for identifying special causes and signals for correct actions in the process is a critical and important approach to evaluate processes for improving quality and reducing reworks and scraps. So that their effects can be found and the necessary preventive action can be suggested before a large number of nonconforming products are manufactured. The determination of variability that can follow by CCS affects the cost and quality of process. To eliminate the high scrap ratio, rework cost, and to ensure customer satisfaction, CCs are effective quality tools to determine whether a process is in-control or out of control in a production environment. Currently, there are many applications in the industry where quality characteristics of a product or a process are analyzed by CCs. Monitoring of some types of quality characteristics are not correct, if the quality-related characteristics cannot be represented in numerical forms, such as characteristics for appearance, softness, color, then CCs for attributes are used. The theory of classical CCs requires all the data to be exactly known. But sometimes, we need human judgments and evaluations to construct CCs or process’ uncertainties cannot be defined by crisp numbers. In these cases, we can successfully use the fuzzy set theory (FST) to design CCs based on attributes. The major contribution of FST is its capability of representing vague data or managing uncertainty. FST is a systematic base in dealing with situations, which are ambiguous or not well defined. Fuzzy control charts (FCCs) based on human judgments, uncertainties, or vagueness are utilized when vague data is used as real-valued interpretations of uncertainty and vagueness. Recently, extensions of fuzzy sets are often used to manage uncertainties of process. We also know that one of the extensions of FST named type-2 fuzzy sets has fuzzy membership degrees that ability for more flexible modeling uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy sets or traditional fuzzy sets. This paper presents a design of CCs for nonconformities called control charts for attributes based on type-2 fuzzy sets and a real case application in the automotive sector. The control limits (CLs) and central limit (CL) values have been obtained. Two well-known attributes control charts named",

The results of the study reveal that of the three processes LBW causes the least environmental impacts whereas FSW causes the highest environmental impacts in all six categories.

After many efforts and partial results, this conjecture was independently proved by Andrei Bulatov and the author in 2017. In this paper we consider one of two main ingredients of my proof, that is, strong subalgebras that allow us to reduce domains of the variables iteratively. To explain how this idea works we show the algebraic properties of strong subalgebras and provide self-contained proof of two important facts about the complexity of the CSP. First, we prove that if a constraint language is not preserved by a WNU operation then the corresponding CSP is NP-hard. Second, we characterize all constraint languages that can be solved by local consistency checking. Additionally, we characterize all idempotent algebras not having a WNU term of a concrete arity 𝑛, not having a WNU term, having WNU terms of all arities greater than 2. Most of the results presented in the paper are not new, but I believe this paper can help to understand my approach to CSP and the new self-contained proof of known facts will be also useful.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing label-free malignant cells from healthy ones by their laser scattering spectra is still a tough challenge in label-free cells detection methods. During cells malignant transferring, some tiny structural differences occurs. The nucleus, as the most important internal structure, has very close relationships with cell’s healthy state. In this paper, cells with similar size but different tiny nucleus differences are set as the research objects. A novel cell’s laser scattering processing algorithm, even interval incident angle (EIIA) algorithm, is developed which is effective in distinguish label-free cells with tiny nucleus’ size difference. The laser scattering spectra of human acute leukaemia Jurkat cell models with different nuclei are processed by EIIA to test its sensitivity and reliability. The results prove that cell’s original tightly compacted laser scattering spectra have been well separated by EIIA. A consistent rule for cell’s nucleus becoming larger can be obviously observed in EIIA processed laser scattering results, which is promising to be an effective standard for identifying malignant larger nucleus cells from healthy ones; therefore, a valid pathway for identify label-free cells simply and directly by their laser scattering spectra can be implemented by EIIA. Also, it may supply an important clinic diagnosis tool to detect malignant cells in early cancerous stage without any dying and marking procedures.",

Data bursts that are contending at the output of node A are exported to the feedback node where the bursts are uploaded at different available wavelengths at different time slots determined by the control circuitry. Blocking probability of the proposed network is estimated and performance of the network is estimated in terms of incoming traffic vs blocking probability for different network parameters like incoming data rate, bandwidth utilization factor etc. Blocking probability of a network varies with optical fiber nonlinearities and different network parameters. Here in this paper few important nonlinear and optical network parameters are considered while calculating the blocking probabilities of switching node, feedback node and both. Results show that the performance of the OBS network improves significantly by the introduction of the feedback node.",

Linguistic data can be transformed into numerical values to handle them with traditional statistical techniques by using the fuzzy set theory. Fuzzy systems are suitable for uncertain or approximate reasoning, especially for the system with a mathematical model that is difficult to derive. The fuzzy set theory allows decision making with estimated values under incomplete or uncertain information. Classical Shewhart control charts monitor and evaluate the process as “in control” or “out of control”. The fuzzy control charts additionally have the ability to consider linguistic or uncertain values and incorporate flexibility to the control limits. In this paper, the control charts of “fuzzy nonconformities per unit with α-cut” are developed. A real case application is given for the fuzzy nonconformities per unit in a truck engine manufacture.",

    "abstract": "Laser welding offers considerable advantages over the conventional welding techniques such as precision of operation, high speed welding, and small heat affected zone. Laser welding also provide improved mechanical and metallurgical properties of the weld section, due to localized high intensity heating, as compared to those produced by the conventional techniques. Although the process is fast, the high cooling rates may results in hot spots in the weld section, especially when oxide compounds are presents. In this case, the release of oxygen and other carbonic gases in the weld section are responsible for the formation of the hot spots in this region. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate into some of the mechanical properties, such as the elastic modulus and hardness, of the weld sections. In the present study, laser welding of steel sheets is carries out at different combinations of laser welding parameters. The elastic modulus of the weld section is obtained through the three-point bending tests. The hardness across the weld section is measured using microindentation testing. The heat affected zone (HAZ) of the welds resulted is assessed after incorporating the optical and scanning electron microscopes. The oxide compounds formed in the weld section are also analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that the laser produced weld sections have lower elastic modules than the base material, provided that some small variation in the elastic modulus for the weld sections are observed when the welding parameters are changed. The hardness profile across the weld cross-section and the optical photographs reveal that the HAZ is considerably narrow.",

In this paper a comprehensive thermal and structural finite element analysis is conducted to investigate the effect that these laser beam geometries have on the process and the final product characteristics. To achieve this, the temperature distribution, deformation, plastic strains and stresses produced by different beam geometries are compared numerically.

A universal sequential logic module (USLM) suitable for local data transfer in a programmed sequential logic circuit is presented. A redundant multiple-valued sequential logic operation is also proposed, where linear summation of time-by-time adjacent bits is fully utilized to increase the input/output throughput of a sequential logic circuit. Moreover, packet data transfer scheme is introduced to make programmable interconnection possible in the bit-serial data transfer between cells composed of the multiple USLMs.",

It was found that the density of the glass decreases by increasing the Neodymium content, and the molar volume VM follows the same trend. Optical absorption and transmission spectra were measured in the range from 190 to 1100 nm, and two broad bands are observed in both UV and IR regions.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a type of inherited haemoglobin disease. It is resulting from point mutation in the β-haemoglobin gene, producing a phenotype of sickle haemoglobin HbS. There are many different clinical and chemical methods of SCA diagnosis which depend on the chemical structure of HbS and its electro potential. In this work we use the optical properties of blood samples for highly specific detection of heamopathological disorder with respect to their blood group type using a 650 nm wavelength diode laser. We then investigate if there any relationships between blood group type and haemoglobin disorder. We have here a first attempt to assemble an integrated photo-bio detector for such disorders using laser wavelength that is absorbed by normal blood so that any change in transmittance value interprets as pathological disorders of haemoglobin according to blood group and anaemia type. We designed the proposed photo-bio detector according to Beer-Lamberts law using a diode laser of 650 nm wavelength as a source of illumination. The laser beam passed through a cuvette of blood sample, and then transmitted light directed to a focusing lens that reduces laser beam diameter to 2 mm. An optical sensor window of laser power meter receives and measures the volts of the transmitted laser beam. The readings that displayed on the laser power meter were taken and analysed statistically using compare means values and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The main findings of our research were that the photo-bio detector is capable of distinguishing between different blood groups, with different cases of haemoglobin disorder, SCA and iron deficiency anaemia from normal blood of the same blood type. The differences in readings of the photo-bio detector resulted from differences in the amino acids of the red blood cells (RBCs), plasma membrane that responsible of blood group types and the haemoglobin concentration either normal, sickled deficient or iron deficiency anaemia and oxygen content. According to haemoglobin concentration as well as construction RBCs corpuscles, the reading on biosensor was affected in the form of rise or fall in transmittance values of laser light.

The main process variables in the present study were applied laser power and scan speed. Followed by LSA, a detailed characterization of the alloyed zone was carried out in terms of surface roughness, microstructure, composition, and phases present. The wear resistance property was evaluated by fretting wear testing unit against WC ball. There is a significant improvement in hardness due to LSA (310 to 320 VHN) as compared to 245 VHN of the as-received AISI 304 stainless steel substrate. The wear resistance property was also found to be improved due to mainly grain refinement, precipitation refinement and supersaturation of Cr and Ni in the matrix.

The sample consisted of 112 experimental students and a similar group of control students. Data were collected by means of a pre-course and post-course problem-solving quiz, observations and interviews.

This learning model has the ability to learn selection rules and strategies. Through the NP-Complete problem and the IRIS dataset species identification, the effectiveness of the algorithm in the discrete state and the continuous state is verified respectively. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy is close to 100%. The model has the ability to solve nonlinear model recognition problems, and the single neuron has a strong computing power.

More efficient acceptor groups (pyridinium, benzazolium, benzothiazolium) on the carbazole donor core resulted in improved second- and third-order nonlinear optical properties.

First, the fuzzification admitting all values from the unit interval is discussed. Fuzzifications based on conjunctors should be a proper extension of classical equivalence relations and partitions. The one–to–one correspondence between crisp equivalence relations and partitions should have a counter-part in fuzzy framework; this point of view leads to the same class of fitting conjunctors for fuzzy equivalence relations and fuzzy partitions. The relationship to triangular norms is shown, too. Several examples are introduced. The structure of fitting conjunctors based fuzzy equivalence relations and fuzzy partitions is investigated. In the case of generated conjunctors, the relationship of fuzzy equivalence relations and pseudo-metrics is shown.

However conventional numeral representations are thought as intrinsically sequential, while some redundant numeral representations exalt the CA parallelism in a space/time trade-off. Usually the emigration toward an advantageous redundant numeric representation is costless, but the inverse one implies a cost that annuls the benefits in terms of computation time. The problem then arises when the result of an operation must be utilized in the conventional representation. This paper explores the properties of the conventional representation embodied in a CA together with the addition of natural numbers and the corresponding ones of a redundant representation, the rules and time cost for the passage from conventional numeral system to redundant one and vice versa. The results permit to individuate the CA computation context (longest sequence of additions or operations based on addition), when redundancy could be exploited advantageously.",

For this purpose, the glass samples were treated by a hydrogenous plasma at atmospheric pressure, resulting in an absolute decrease in transmission of 2.43% for the used laser wavelength after 30 minutes of plasma treatment. Machining experiments were performed on both pure and plasma treated heavy flint glass. It was shown that by the presented method, the roundness form error of the ablated holes could be reduced by a factor of 1.9. Further, no formation of debris was observed when applying the hybrid laser-plasma ablation method.",

Indeed, our richest searches for complex automata utilized symmetry, required very simple gliders to be viable, and used bounds on input entropy in Monte Carlo searches.

It is, therefore, considered to be a potential material and have a wide range of application in the field of biomedics. Due to the difficulties in obtaining the optimized parameters required for the laser processing, the titanium is still used little. This study lays the foundations for better understanding and control of the selective laser melting (SLM) process parameters mainly laser power, scanning speed and beam diameter. Since, in SLM of titanium, controlling the degrees of porosity and increase the build rate is quite a challenge and, in this study, the commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) formation is investigated by means of single layer track formation to understand the processing mechanism and the effect of SLM processing parameters on the resulting porosity of the final track. The optimized parameters based on optimum surface porosity which is mainly around 25 to 30% achieved are presented. The resulting surface morphology of the CP-Ti processed track was examined and explained. Balling phenomenon was observed at low laser energy density and the combined effect of lower scanning speed and higher laser power results in formation spatters. The chemical composition of the laser track surface is studied and it was found that formation of protective oxide coating occurred. The influence of SLM processing parameters on porosity is statistically modelled and analysed using regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). This study mainly focuses its attention on the increase in build rate and porosity of optimized selective laser process parameters. From this study, it is shown that scanning speed and laser beam diameter are the dominant factors which affects the porosity of selective laser melted track.",

Although the input of patrol robot improves the intelligence and modernization of substation patrol work, it also gives rise to some problems that are not favorable to the work of patrol robot, such as loose or bad contact of wired charging interface, copper oxidation at the electric end, etc., which restrict the normal work of substation patrol robot. Based on this, in order to avoid the occurrence of such problems, the core algorithm of electromagnetic resonance wireless charging technology is studied. To be specific, the existing wireless charging technologies are compared by comparison method, and magnetic resonance is finally chosen as the wireless power supply method in this paper, and then the design scheme of wireless charging device is given. Finally, the calculation method of coupling system efficiency and system output efficiency is given through the test of magnetically coupled resonant wireless charging efficiency. It is also pointed out that the radio energy transmission efficiency is affected by the coil distance, resonant frequency and the number of turns of the receiving coil. It can be seen that in practical engineering, we can focus on these factors to improve the efficiency of radio energy transmission and promote the work progress and efficiency of substation patrol robot.

The Image Database System Kernel (DBMSK), which is composed of two software applications: the DBMSK Server and Client, uses typical three-layer architecture. For retrieval by target image, we investigate three histogram based search methods in RGB and HSV color spaces: histogram intersection, histogram Euclidian distance and histogram quadratic distance. Because a histogram characterize an image by color distribution, information about image shape and location being discarded, better search result are obtained when image has text semantic information attached and search takes into account this semantic information.",

After a controlled experiment to verify the correctness of the model, numerical calculations are executed to analyse the distribution of range noise in three-dimensional (3-D) images obtained by the laser imaging radar. The results show that with the decreasing of signal to noise ratio (SNR), the distribution of range noise obviously deviates from normal distribution and which is an asymmetrical distribution with a rapid rising edge and relatively slower falling edge. Once the SNR is larger than 7.2, the distribution of range noise approximately obeys the normal distribution and the laser radar works in a better condition.",

    "abstract": "In this work an automated approach for 3-D roof reconstruction using airborne images and LiDAR data is presented. The roofs are assumed to consist of planar parts. Reconstruction is thus conducted using plane detection with random sample consensus (RANSAC), followed by a geometric refinement and merging of the neighbouring segments to reduce over segmentation. Planes belonging to the walls and ground are then detected and excluded, and the roof outlines are vectorized using the alpha-shapes algorithm. The resulting polygons are refined using straight three-dimensional (3-D) edges reconstructed through automatic edge extraction and matching, along with virtual 3-D edges from the intersection of adjacent planes. Additionally, 3-D corner points constructed through the intersection of the 3-D lines are used. The 3-D edges and corner points are integrated with the point clouds belonging to the planes, and the roof outlines are again detected using the alpha-shapes algorithm. Finally, a regularisation of the roof outlines is performed, although the topological correctness of the roof planes is not enforced. The quantitative evaluation uses several metrics for both the correctness and completeness of the roof polygons and for their geometric accuracy. The average mean and median value for the correctness of the roof polygons are 84 and 96%, respectively, and for completeness are 76 and 88%. In addition, different cases and problems are analysed and visually presented.",

The above practices are just some steps to find out the best equalization technique that should be employed in the process so that at the receiving side we get a signal which is very nearly a replica of the transmitted signal. This clearly reflects that the BER is minimized. Simulation results are included.",

In this paper, the deep neural network model is applied to identify the household electrical appliances in nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM). The accuracy of traditional methods with the voltage current (V-I) trajectory feature is low to fulfill practical requirement in the complex environment with noise interference. Especially, when the number of the V-I trajectory feature sample data is very small, traditional methods are more difficult to recognize the household electrical appliances. Hence, based on the deep neural network and transfer learning theory, a deep transfer learning method is presented to solve the small-sample problem of data in status-monitor of electrical appliances. Meanwhile, aiming at the problem that a large number V-I trajectory images are not available due to noise, a preprocessing algorithm is proposed to improve the quality of the V-I trajectory image data. In lab test, the average recognition rate of the four kinds of household electrical appliances by using the proposed method reaches up to 99%. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher recognition accuracy than traditional methods.",

The film was integrated into an Erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) cavity to generate a mode-locked fiber laser operating at 1558.9 nm. The vector soliton pulses were obtained at a 12.8 MHz repetition rate and 1.3 ps pulse width due to the phase-locking process between two orthogonal polarization modes as the soliton propagates periodically within a laser cavity. The results show that the vector soliton can be generated using a cost-effective and simple approach based on GO film in mode-locked EDFL cavity.",

It usually has more than two states, and thus can be considered as a multi-valued function, called a structure function. Since many structure functions are monotone increasing, their multi-state systems can be represented compactly by edge-valued multivalued decision diagrams (EVMDDs). This paper presents an analysis method of multi-state systems with multi-state components using EVMDDs. Experimental results show that, by using EVMDDs, structure functions can be represented more compactly than existing methods using ordinary MDDs. Further, EVMDDs yield comparable computation time for system analysis. This paper also proposes a new diagnosis method using EVMDDs, and shows that the proposed method can infer the most probable causes for system failures more efficiently than conventional methods based on Bayesian networks.",

The pulses from the PMT are counted by a Counting Board at a given sample time. Then, the power spectrum is calculated and the particle size deduced using a characteristic decay constant.

The circuit operates in transimpdance mode (TI) and current-mode (CM) when the input signal is current. The circuit provides simultaneously three voltage outputs and a single current output. The circuit exhibits low input impedance which is highly suitable for cascading without using buffers. The circuit can be converted into voltage-mode (VM) and transadmittance-mode (TA) by simply placing resistor at input. The use of grounded capacitors is suitable for IC implementation and also all the resistors are virtually grounded. The circuit enjoys orthogonal tuning of band width, and pole frequency. The sensitively figures are equal to or less than unity. PSPICE simulation results the confirm the workability of the proposed filter.",

    "abstract": "Due to the robust construction of AC drives, the majority of industries use AC drives. Low maintenance cost, Low power loss, easy to use and simple arrangement for starting the motor are the advantages due to which it is widely used in the industries. But the AC drives are constant speed drives and its speed can not be controlled smoothly over a wide range and operation in either direction. Direct Current (DC) motor is also an important drive configuration which is widely used in many applications. It is used in wide range of power and speed. The ease of access and good performance of the DC motor decides the growth of its use in the number of applications. There are many conventional methods available for controlling the speed of the DC motor, modern methods include high-speed switching power devices. The power switching devices provide accuracy and precision to speed control of the DC motor. The most efficient method for controlling the speed of DC motor is PWM control, it is very easy as well as cost efficient method. It is done by using the microcontroller which removes bulkiness of the system and provides increased reliability and flexibility to the control. When the load on the DC motor increases then it’s current requirement also increases. For high current, the normal H-bridge configuration is not efficient as it gets heated up and then burns. The design of high current bearing H-bridge configuration or motor driver and generation of PWM and programs for the microcontroller are discussed in detail in this research paper.",

In the cell output circuit, switched current sources are used to reduce power dissipation. Moreover, the CMOS logic is used to make driving capability of a D flip-flop high. As a result, the maximum throughput of the proposed digit-serial reconfigurable VLSI using quaternary cells is twice that of the bit-serial reconfigurable VLSI, while the power-delay product is reduced to 74%.

With these techniques, including: open- and closed-aperture Z-scan; white-light continuum (WLC) Z-scan; one- and two-photon fluorescence; emission and excitation anisotropy; direct luminescence lifetime measurements; and femtosecond-pump WLC-probe spectroscopy, we have investigated many unique classes of organic dyes with nonlinear responses due to two and three-photon absorption, excited-state absorption induced by one and multi-photon absorption, and combinations of these processes. By performing both experiment and modeling, including quantum chemical calculations, determining both frequency degenerate and non-degenerate spectra along with their associated temporal dynamics, the responsible physical mechanisms can be determined. Additionally, we are studying the nonlinear refraction of these materials and the observed nonlinear responses, both absorptive and refractive, which mirror those observed in bulk semiconductors with relatively minor differences). This allows us to apply our experience and previously developed theories of modeling semiconductors to organics. Working in collaboration with optical scientists, physicists, materials scientists, and chemists has greatly increased our progress towards predictive structure-property relations in organics.",

The most important saving in the proposed architecture is in the number of Galois Field (GF) multipliers, the most area and power consuming component. Earlier architectures are using more number of GF multipliers, but in the proposed architecture the number of GF multipliers has been drastically reduced to unity. This makes the VLSI implementation of the architecture more easy and area and power efficient.

Herein we present a supersaturated solid solution of Mg in Fe which was achieved by mechanical alloying and then consolidated by selective laser melting (SLM). First, solid solution of Mg in Fe was accomplished by mechanical alloying in the condition of elements inter-dispersion at low temperature. Then the alloyed powders were rapidly consolidated by SLM to avoid the segregation and evaporation of Mg in the case of extremely short melting and cooling time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for the Fe-Mg powders showed that Mg peaks disappeared while Fe peaks broadened and shifted to a low angle after milling for 40 hours, indicating the successful solution of Mg in Fe; consequently, the Fe-Mg alloy presented a much lower potential of -0.805 V than that of alloy at -0.542 V without milling, which increased degradation rate by 2.74 times after immersion for 21 days. MG-63 cells proliferated more rapidly, indicating good cytocompatibility, which showed potentials for artificial bone applications.",

We have achieved the lowest poling voltage to date for maximum EO coefficient, 300 V, for a 2-layer waveguide structure consisting of a 2 µm thick NLO polymer layer and 2 µm thick conductive cladding layer. The dielectric constants of both the NLO polymer core and passive polymer cladding materials used for conventional polymer based integrated optic devices are typically very similar in magnitude. This suggests that only a small fraction of the applied modulation voltage is reaching the NLO polymer core layer, requiring 4–5 times higher modulation voltage than the desired Vp. We have demonstrated a factor of 2 decrease in the modulation voltage using the same conductive polymer due to the fact that it possesses a much higher dielectric constant than the core material at the modulation frequency tested. The results of this research show promise for shorter, lower operating voltage devices.",

Their characteristics in the time domain and the frequency domain are very similar and it is difficult to separate them. In order to solve this problem we introduced the fractional domain adaptive filtering algorithm. The analytic expression of fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) of laser radar’s return signal in theory was deduced and proved that the return signal has the characteristic of energy aggregation in fractional domain, but the co-frequency interference and noise do not have this characteristic. On this basis we constructed fractional domain adaptive filter and did filtering experiment on the return signal of coherent imaging laser radar developed by our team. By comparing the spectrum information before filtering and that after filtering it was obvious that the co-frequency interference had been mostly filtered and the complete signal was reserved without distortion. Signal noise ratio (SNR) was enhanced from 1.06 dB to 4.67 dB simultaneously; moreover, there was not any other involved noise added to the return signal of laser radar. In this work the fractional domain adaptive filtering algorithm was proved to provide a novel method for coherent imaging laser radar signal processing.",

    "abstract": "Surface modification of grey cast iron by using laser cladding can improve surface properties of low-cost materials, thereby expanding their applications and prolonging serving time. In this study, the laser rescanning process was designed to optimize the thermal stress distribution in the clad layer. Numerical simulation and experiments were conducted to study the thermodynamic response distribution under the laser rescanning process. The influence of scanning speeds was analysed to optimize the process parameters. Results indicated that rescanning reduced the transient thermal stress of clad layer and released internal residual tensile stress, thereby improving the anti-cracking toughness of the cast iron coating. Meanwhile, thermal input of rescanning was controlled at a low level. Thickening degree of dendritic structure in secondary development can be controlled within 20% and reducing degree of residual tensile stress reached as high as 40%. Scanning speed had an obvious influence on thermal stress, and release of tensile stress should be maximized while maintaining a fine-grain structure; moreover, 500 W power and 200 mm/min scanning speed constituted the optimal rescanning parameter combination.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest on the development of frequency tunable laser sources in ultraviolet (UV) spectral regions having several applications. Different applications need specific ranges of wavelengths and for most applications, wavelength tunability of the laser sources is required, in addition to other desirable characteristics. Exploiting the nonlinear optical (NLO) effects in various potential crystals including in some newly discovered crystals, by employing different novel NLO frequency conversion techniques, generation of widely tunable UV laser radiation have been presented. The NLO frequency conversion techniques that have been employed in the present experiments are SHG and SFM and the used materials are BBO, CLBO, and LB4, which are negatively birefringent uniaxial crystals. Several novel phase-matching techniques, such as noncollinear phase-matching, tangential phase-matching and walk-off compensated scheme have been employed for generation of widely tunable efficient laser radiation. The shortest VUV wavelength generated in the processes is 187.9 nm at room temperature in BBO crystal using Nd:YAG laser radiation as one of the fundamental radiation in a type-I SFM interaction. The shortest achievable wavelength tunability in CLBO crystal is reported to be ~ 195.3 nm, by type-I SFM with Nd:YAG laser radiation at room temperature, although CLBO crystal is transparent down to 180 nm. Another LB4 crystal although transparent below 200 nm, generation below 205 nm is not possible through the presented technique. However, LB4 crystal has been employed for generation of UV laser radiation covering in 205–400 nm spectral region by employing NLO SHG and SFM techniques.",

By obtaining the beam profile propagated through pristine and treated samples, nonlinear refractive index of red lake doped PVC films is found to be positive. This magnitude is increased due to UV treatment. The optical limiting behaviour of samples is investigated by measurement of transmission through the sample, which is remained unchanged in comparison with pristine sample. The third order nonlinearity of UV treated samples is measured using Z-scan method.

Based on the results of experiments, basic etching appearances and etching velocities by excimer laser etching silicon under the two mediums were researched, and the etching appearances of several metals in two mediums were contrastively analysed. As a result, the molten material is easy to be removed in water-assisted micromachining, which helps to improve the processed surface quality; the restriction of water improves the impact effect which leads to increase the etching velocity of silicon, but it is easy to produce micro-cracks in the brittle material. Laser etching metal underwater is helpful to improve the surface quality, but the etching rate decreased.",

This paper presents various flow regimes in two types of open-cell metal foam. For each flow regime, certain values for the permeability and form drag coefficient are exhibited by the foam. The traditional Reynolds number for pipe flow is favored in marking transition from laminar to turbulent flows. Values of the permeability and form drag coefficient are obtained for the different flow regimes, by first distinguishing flow regimes. The Forchheimer equation is shown to represent the pressure drop in both the transitional and turbulent flow regimes. A discussion about two kinds of transition and their physics is provided.",

The interface also supports good practices in the domain, and visualizes the goal structure. Constraint-based tutors diagnose student’s solution, and provide feedback on the basis of this analysis. Feedback provides long and short-term learning advantages through revision of faulty knowledge in the context of learners’ errors. Our tutors provide progressive levels of feedback, with each new message specifying more detail about the error and the basic domain principle that was violated. Finally, we also engage the student in discussion about problem-solving actions, which support the learner to reflect on his/her actions and strengthen relationships between procedural and declarative knowledge.",

We also introduced mathematical descriptions of the proposed method. Finally, we built an experimental system to simulate the practical system in high-speed railways at a speed of 300 km/h.

The game is played in the cellular automata manner, i.e., with local and synchronous interaction. The effect of spatial structure and variable entangling on the evolving dynamics are assessed in fair and unfair contests, both in the two and three parameter strategy spaces. It is concluded that the intrinsic asymmetry of the BOS game induces a very interesting modification in the payoffs that the players achieve when varying the degree of entanglement of the player’s strategies.",

Results show that WALSM process can eliminate the recast layer, decrease the taper angle, and reduce the HAZ thickness with no microcracks. Orthogonal analysis shows that the waterjet velocity and pulse frequency are the most significant factors affecting the efficiency of WALSM. To further improve the machining efficiency of WALSM in a larger depth, a hybrid laser processing and WALSM process were proposed for drilling large depth holes with high machining efficiency, high accuracy and good surface quality. The hybrid machining process holds great potential in drilling shaped cooling holes on the turbine blades in the aviation industry.",

Smaller APL values result in faster evaluation of the function represented by a decision diagram. For some functions, the APL depends strongly on the variable order. In this paper, we propose an exact and a heuristic algorithm to determine the variable order that minimizes the APL. Our exact algorithm uses branch-and-bound. Our heuristic algorithm uses dynamic reordering, where selected pairs of variables are swapped. This paper also proposes an exact and a heuristic algorithm to determine the pairs of binary variables that reduce the APL of multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) for a 4-valued input 2-valued output function. Experimental results show that the heuristic algorithm is much faster than the exact one but produces comparable APLs. Both algorithms yield an improvement over an existing algorithm in both APL and runtime. Experimental results for 2-valued cases and 4-valued cases are shown.",

The machine is able to implement quite general transformations on a broad class of topological spaces by means of Hilbert-space representations. Neural morphogenesis provides a model for the physical structure of the machine and means by which it may be configured, a process that involves the definition of signal pathways between two-dimensional data areas and the setting of interconnection strengths within them. This approach also provides a very flexible means of reconfiguring the internal structure of the machine.",

Novice programmers have little knowledge about program execution and may see it as an abstract and non-deterministic process.

This paper reports on an empirical experiment in program comprehension where 16 subjects used Jeliot to comprehend two Java programs. The experiment focused on how the experience level and complexity of the program affected (a) the patterns of interaction with the tool, (b) the gaze behavior, (c) the use of visualization, and (d) the cognitive processes related to program comprehension. This was done by investigating the protocols obtained from an eye-tracker, interaction logging, and comprehension summaries. An interaction between experience and behavior was found. Experts read the whole code first, constructed a hypothesis, and tested it against the animation. Novice programmers did not read the code first. They animated the program directly, and replayed the animation several times focusing on the difficult sections. The results reveal the potentials of gaze as an additional modality in an adaptive tool for program visualization.",

The purpose of this study is to propose a fuzzy multicriteria approach for the selection of the most appropriate site(s) for promoting ecotourism activities in urban areas using a modified PROMETHEE methodology. In the suggested methodology, the importance weights of the evaluation criteria are determined by a fuzzy pair-wise comparisons procedure.

From the statistical results in the Taguchi experiment, the laser mode was found to be the most important factor that substantially affects the aspect ratio. Strong interaction between the power and focus position was found in the Taguchi experiment. The optimized weldment was mainly of columnar dendritic structure in the weld zone (WZ), while the heat affected zone (HAZ) exhibited equiaxed grain structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results showed that the WZ remained the B2 austenite structure without any precipitates, but with a significant decrease of phase transformation temperatures.

The Titanium nanoparticles were deposited onto the surface of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film via an electron beam evaporation process and inserted into an Erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) cavity to achieve passive Q-switching. A tunable bandpass filter was used in the EDFL cavity to tune the operating wavelength of the Q-switched EDFL from 1535 to 1565 nm. At operating wavelength of 1535 nm, the repetition rate of the self-starting Q-switching pulses is increased from 18.3 kHz to 34.2 kHz while the pulse width is reduced from 19.4 to 10.45 μs with increasing pump power from 14.9 to 37.7 mW. The Q-switching pulse shows no spectral modulation with a peak-to-pedestal ratio of 68 dB indicating the high stability of the laser. The highest pulse energy of 0.25 μJ was obtained with pump power of 37.7 mW at operating wavelength of 1565 nm.

The spectral analysis of the configurations of rule 60 at each time step in the evolution reveals that spatial periodicity emerges as the evolution proceeds and the patterns with longer period split into the ones with shorter period. This phenomenon is analogous to the cascade process in which large scale eddies split into smaller ones in turbulence.

This study investigates the effects of two sets of laser processing parameters. Set 1. Low Laser Processing Parameters (LLPP): laser power of 600 W; scanning speed of 2000 mm/min; focused position of -10.00 mm. Set 2. High Laser Process Parameters (HLPP): laser power of 800 W; scanning speed of 3000 mm/min; focused position of -10.00 mm. On overlapped multi track laser transformation hardened bead geometry responses: hardened bead width, hardened depth, centre to centre pitch, overlapped region depth, angle of hardened bead profile, power density and overlapping ratio. The main reason for this is the role of scanning speed. The scanning speed has the most influent on hardened bead width, and hardened depth. As scanning speed decreases, hardened bead width and hardened depth increases thereby allowing more laser-material interaction time, which in turn increases centre to centre pitch, overlapped region depth, and angle of hardened bead profile naturally; therefore, low laser process parameter for CW spherical beam has ensured higher values of experimental measured responses of hardened- bead profile. The results demonstrated that in all the cases the overlapping ratio is found to be approximately equal to overlapping ratio 0 and hence overlapped laser surface transformation hardening of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, ensured a wide and uniform hardened zone of a multi-track.",

Fuzziness arises naturally from the imprecision or vagueness of the pixel color values and human perception. The Hue and Value in the HSV color space are used to construct the 2-D intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, not only the membership degrees are considered but also the uncertainties that are involved in the non-membership degrees and are known as the hesitation measures are considered. The proposed similarity measure of intuitionistic fuzzy sets is a fuzzy quantity, rather than crisp quantity due to the vague concept of the similarities.

An important problem is lack of methods of prediction of how the process parameters will influence characteristics of a final product, as the influence can be significant, especially in terms of strength. The paper presents a concept of a soft-computing based algorithm of optimization of Fused Deposition Modeling process parameters (FDM is one of the most widespread 3D printing technologies). A core module of this algorithm is a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) performed on digital 3D models resembling structure of a real product and thus named thread models. In the paper, the concept of algorithm is presented in great detail and positive results of studies validating the used FEA approach are shown.",

    "abstract": "Laser percussion drilling is a process, which is of great interest in many industrial applications. If the components to be drilled have a closed cavity, as is typical in airfoil blade/vane, fuel injector nozzles etc., the laser beam must drill through the first surface but should be switched off before it can damage the underlying second surface. Therefore, it is important to be able, immediately, to detect when a hole has been completely drilled through the work-piece. The precise determination of the breakthrough process is, however, complicated and can lead to uncertainties in the optimisation of the laser drilling process, the parameters, unacceptable hole quality, wastage of time and the laser beam can also damage adjacent surfaces and back-wall. A precise and rapid method of determining when a through hole has been drilled in the work-piece is presented. The breakthrough detection device has been developed based on a photo sensor and a filter, and will detect only laser radiation. In this arrangement, one end of an optical fibre cable was held just below the work-piece being radiated and the other end of the fibre was coupled to a photo-sensor. The output of the photo sensor triggers an electronic circuit when it receives the “breakthrough signal” i.e. the laser radiation has passed through to the exit side. The electronic circuit can cause the pulses to be interrupted or switch off the laser. It is also possible to allow an additional predefined number of pulses after breakthrough has been achieved and then stop the laser pulses. We have observed that these additional pulses serve as finishing pulses and improve the quality of the drilled hole. Breakthrough detection has been demonstrated successfully and improves the hole quality and consistency by detecting the precise instant of breakthrough and then allowing an appropriate number of additional user defined pulses before switching off the laser power.",

In particular we show possible improvements to the heat dissipation in the Cache-CPU system, register number reduction in a computational pipeline, reversible encoding and compression and the design of the so called Universal Reversible Logic cell. Finally, to show that the logical reversibility alone can be used to implement the introduced concepts in the current technology, a Toffoli gate is implemented using adiabatic CMOS and compared to non adiabatic Toffoli gates. It is shown that our implementation of the Toffoli gate, saves power and registers when used in the reversible concepts introduced above.",

The compactness has been measured in the number of product terms in the case of functional expressions and the number of nodes, the width, and the interconnections in the case of decision diagrams. In this paper, we discuss Fourier representations on finite non-Abelian groups in synthesis for regularity. The initial domain group for a logic function (binary or multiple-valued) is replaced by a non-Abelian group by encoding of variables. The function is then decomposed into matrix-valued Fourier coefficients, that are easy to implement as building blocks over a technological platform with regular structure.We point out that spectral representation of non-Abelian groups is capable of capturing regularities in functions and transferring them in the spectral domain. In many cases, weak regularities in the original domain are converted into much stronger regularities in the spectral domain due to the regular structure of unitary irreducible group representations upon which the Fourier expressions are based.",

The principle is based on the measurement of the torsion angle induced on the shaft when a torque is applied on it. This optical torque sensor has been tested for aluminium, steel and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Plexiglas) shafts with different designs and different geometries depending on the applications it is dedicated to. The torsion angle has been measured with 0.001º accuracy. We analysed the light propagation in an electromagnetic and opto-geometrical way applicable to the sensor and the analysis of the theoretical and the experimental responses of the sensor as a function of the material nature and its geometry is achieved. We obtained experimentally a high sensitivity and a very high stiffness adjustable depending on the application. The comparison between the theoretical and the experimental results gave a maximum difference between 1.68 and 3.40%. We tested the temperature fluctuations influence for ∆T = 130ºC and the results gave 7% difference with the theory. This sensor design offers, compared to some others, a simple, efficient and economic technique to measure the torque. This original technique permits the accurate measurement of torque applied on shaft with a very high stiffness. Torque sensor variable length (L = 5 to 32 cm) has demonstrated a maximum stiffness at 1190 Nm/rad which is very interesting because it is superior to existing stiffness for steering systems and desired data for automotive industry (new generation of steering systems). The main advantage of the studied sensor is that this actuator is adjustable as a function of the sensitivity and the stiffness wanted for different applications. These results give us good perspectives for our applications in automotive and aerospace industries.",

A key point in the development is the use of the experience of a human expert in the formation of a fuzzy knowledge base that allows us to describe the relationship between the inductive voltage, the distance of objects in an unknown dynamic environment, and their linear and angular output velocities. To achieve this goal, we have developed a type- 2 fuzzy controller and compared it against its type-1 counterpart.

The Intermediaries are one of the main players in the telecom network market, and they may acquire network capacity from a set of telecommunication Backbone Providers that offer different pricing and quality of service schemes and sell purchased capacity to end-users in order to make a profit. Unfortunately, the bandwidth demands of customers are not known in advance. Therefore, Intermediaries may end up having either slack capacity or unsatisfied customer demands. In this paper, to overcome these problems, a two-stage stochastic integer programming approach is proposed. The performance of suggested method is validated on several randomly generated scenarios. In addition, the effects of different bandwidth demand distributions are examined by using well-known measures such as Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and Value of Stochastic Solution (VSS).

The results of experiment show that the learning spiking neural P system with belief AdaBoost is effective in diagnosing faults in transformer for thermal and electrical fault situations with dissolved gas data and is superior to other methods, like Improved Three-Ratio Method, Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Learning Spiking Neural P system (LSN P system), in terms of the correctness of diagnosis results.",

In the present study a simplified arrangement of pulsed laser microembossing is introduced which allows a more flexible fabrication process with laser microembossing using a laser scanning scheme. To demonstrate the capability of the manufacturing process microstructures were successfully transferred from high quality silica micromoulds into silver and copper foils by using ultraviolet (UV) excimer laser pulses. The replicated micropatterns had a high accuracy regarding the shape and the spatial resolution. An almost linear correlation between the laser fluence and the height of the embossed microstructures was observed. Surface analytical investigations of the embossed surface areas reveal an increase of the reflectivity due to the significant reduction of the surface roughness down to 3 nm root-mean-square (RMS). This smoothing effect appears both at the microstructures as well as at extended flat surface areas.",

    "abstract": "Most inductive learning methods require that the training data set contains only discrete attributes, which makes it necessary to discretize continuous numeric attributes. Current efforts mainly focus on discretizing data for individual attributes, without taking into account the correlations among attributes and the number of inconsistent records produced by discretization. In addition, existing methods focus only on one-dimensional problem without extensively considering the effect of interval size and class number on discretization schemes. In this paper, we present a method by combining univariate and multivariate bottom-up discretization that employs a novel merging and stopping criterion. First, we present a new merging criterion based on both univariate and multivariate measurement, which synthetically evaluates the variance among the adjacent interval pairs to find the best merge and effectively captures the correlations among the continuous attributes. This is achieved by using the Minimum Description Length Principle and developing a measurement of significance of interval pair among attributes. The advantage of our proposed merging criterion is further analyzed. Second, we present a new stopping criterion with the aim to control the degree of misclassification while maximizing the merging accuracy. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to find the best discretization based on the new merging and stopping criterion. Detailed analysis shows that the proposed method brings higher accuracy to the discretization process. Finally, empirical experiments on 18 real data sets show that our method generates a better discretization scheme that significantly improves the accuracy of classification than existing methods by using popular learning systems such as C4.5 decision tree.",

To do this, Gaussian membership function based fuzzy ranks are integrated into ORESTE with nonlinear projection.

Based on 81978 purchase transactions of 12915 households in 2015, performances of eight major margarine brands are evaluated. In the comparisons, household consumer panel indicators like penetration, purchase frequency, average purchase size, unit price, share of requirements, share of occasions and repeat purchase rate are used as performance criteria.

    "abstract": "Laser micromachining with the use of liquid immersion allows debris control. Use of an immersion technique potentially modifies the ablation mechanism when compared to laser material interactions in a medium of ambient air. Equipment has been developed to allow feature machining under a controllable liquid film and thereby elucidate and quantify and changes in feature topography caused. The findings of this study revealed that immersion of bisphenol A polycarbonate samples in closed thick film flowing filtered water during KrF excimer laser ablation markedly altered feature geometry, waviness and roughness laser machining in ambient air. Feature geometry definition improved with flow velocity. Waviness was found to be less regular and less predictable and roughness became fluence dependant. Variation of flow velocity during immersion resulted in modification of the surface waviness: an optimum flow velocity exists, producing maximum waviness. Surface roughness displayed a power law relationship with flow velocity. These observed effects are explained through examination of the flow – plume interaction: closed thick film flowing filtered water immersion caused a combination of photomechanical etching promoted by plume confinement, laser etching and plume distortion by rapid flow velocity. Furthermore, the influence each of these interactions varied depending on the flow velocity. This is not an eventuality possible when using an open thin film immersed laser ablation technique: film rupture and splashing limited the plume etching contribution to the confined laser ablation process. It is apparent that the changes to feature geometry, waviness and roughness observed when KrF excimer laser machining under closed thick film flowing filtered water were brought about directly by the immersion, rather than by variations in fluence level.",

    "abstract": "As a novel optimization technique, chaos has gained much attention and some applications during the past decade. For a given energy or cost function, by following chaotic ergodic orbits, a chaotic dynamic system may eventually reach the global optimum or its good approximation with high probability. To enhance the performance of the local search method (LS), which is based on the generalized reduced gradient algorithm, hybrid local search method is proposed by incorporating chaos. Thus, LS and chaos are hybridized to form a chaotic dynamic local search method (CDLS), which reasonably combines the searching ability of LS and chaotic searching behavior. In this paper, a CDLS method based on the logistic equation is presented to learn Multiple-Valued Logic (MVL) Networks. Simulation results and comparisons with the traditional back propagation algorithm (BP) and the standard LS method show that the CDLS can effectively enhance the searching efficiency and greatly improve the searching quality within reasonable number of iterations.",

Therefore, the behaviour of the Gaussian vortex beam in the source region receives considerable interest, not least for lasers. In the source region, the Gaussian vortex beam is expressed as a sum of the transverse electric (TE) and the transverse magnetic (TM) terms, and the analytical expressions for the TE and the TM terms have been derived without any approximation. The corresponding magnetic field is obtained by taking the curl of the electric field. By using the accurate expressions for the electromagnetic fields of the Gaussian vortex beam and its TE and TM terms, the angular momentum densities of the Gaussian vortex beam and its TE and TM terms can be calculated. The angular momentum density distributions of the TE term, the TM term, and the Gaussian vortex beam are numerically demonstrated in the source region. The effects of the propagating part and the evanescent part on the angular momentum densities of the TE term, the TM term, and the Gaussian vortex beam are examined in the source region. This research is useful to optical trapping, optical guiding, and optical manipulation using Gaussian vortex beams.",

    "abstract": "In the petroleum industry perforating is a method of making holes through the casing opposite the production formation to allow the oil or gas to flow into the well. In the current explosive shaped charge perforation method there are some serious problems, such as producing debris, uncontrollable hole size and shape, compaction of rock formation in the area next to the tunnel and decreasing permeability. Recent advances in high power laser technology provide a new alternative to replace the current perforating gun. Due to the nature of oil and gas reservoirs, one of the challenges in laser perforation is the laser beam-fluid interaction that results in laser power loss (LPL). In this paper, feed-forward network with back-propagation and generalized regression neural networks have been developed to predict LPL in the laser beam-fluid interaction during laser perforation. Effective parameters in the laser-fluid interaction such as laser power, fluid viscosity and fluid thickness which are related to laboratory tests done by ytterbium-doped multi-clad fibre laser are the inputs and LPL is the output of the neural networks. The developed neural networks have shown high correlation coefficients with low error and the LPL for the laser beam-fluid interaction during laser perforation was predicted with high accuracy.",

The He-Ne laser beam reflected by a corner cube acts as the detection beam, which intersects the oscillating target at two successive positions. The proposed method has the advantage that the speed fluctuating is not a problem. The measurement of the impulse coupling coefficient benefits from an accurate measurement of the oscillating target speed. It is shown that this method is simple, with a good precision and much easier than the conventional methods used in engineering metrology and design to calculate the impulse coupling coefficient of laser propulsion.",

    "abstract": "In thermal spraying, the morphology of sprayed splat raises the coatings adhesion and the properties which are determined by the spraying parameters. Many studies in this field show that the substrate surface temperature as well as cleaning the substrate are two very relevant factors for the splat shape. The hypotheses of substrate surface wettability and contamination or absorption layer on the surfaces are supported by the fact that the near disk-shaped splat can be obtained by increasing the substrate temperature. For cleaning operations, despite all conventional techniques (solvents), laser ablation is powerful enough to eliminate the contaminants on the substrate surface just before powder spraying. Concerning surface heating, laser irradiation can control the treated area and then the oxidation in comparison with the flame technology. In order to understand these effects, an analysis of NiAl splat morphology on a polished TA6V substrate was carried out. Results show that the critical temperature above which the disk shaped splat is formed can be decreased dramatically by laser ablation. Moreover, laser ablation combined with another laser increased the adhesion strength of the coatings.",

    "abstract": "Clock recovery circuits are used in data communication systems for the system synchronization. In general a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit is used to extract the clock signal from the input data stream. The recovered clock signal is always jittered and have to be adjusted by using a dejitter circuit. Tracking these errors over an extended period of time determines the system stability. Sources of jitter in PLL circuit itself are due to some ac components at the VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) input which modulate its output frequency. A narrow band PLL may be used after the recovery circuit to minimize the jitter associated with the recovered clock. This second PLL has to be locked at the same frequency as the recovered clock. Other solution is by using a single PLL with Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO) whose centre frequency is equal to the data bit rate followed by a wide band loop filter. The conversion gain of the VCXO (Hz/V) is very small so a narrow band PLL is resulted without sacrificing the dynamic behaviour. This work presents a proposed system for low jitter clock recovery circuit using two cascaded PLLs which enables to generate several clock frequencies using single VCXO. The proposed described is simulated and verified experimentally. The experimental results confirm the simulation.",

The study proposes a comprehensive approach for refillable and unrefillable bottle design evaluation and selection problem by evaluating a wide variety of criteria that may conflict with each other. To deal with uncertainty, vagueness and subjectivity in the human judgments, the problem is solved by using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The study applies interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets to both refillable and unrefillable bottle design evaluation and selection problem. A real industrial case is presented to show the feasibility and applicability of the method and a sensitivity analysis is also conducted.",

Laser etching is an effective technique to mass fabricate micro-scale structures with low cost and high efficiency. In this work, the laser etching and thermal bonding method were employed to fabricate low cost poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nozzles. To improve the fabrication quality, the conditions for laser cutting and thermal bonding were optimized by orthogonal experiments. The numerical simulation for channel design was carried out and the influence of channel structure on the ink velocity and pressure distribution was studied. The tensile test indicated the high bonding strength of the nozzle, which meets basic requirement for EHD printing.",

The effects of the laser parameters and water jet parameters on the processing depth and width were studied using the single-factor test method. In the case of water jet-assisted laser processing the water jet used provides impacting and cooling effects. The cooling action of the water jet absorbs the excess laser energy applied to the surface of the SiC, reducing the heat affected zone (HAZ) and ablation. The impact of the water jet also washes away the slag generated by the laser from the processing area, avoiding slag accumulation and the formation of the recondensed layer, as well as improving the processing quality. The results of this study suggest that the introduction of water jets can effectively reduce the defects associated with conventional laser processing of ceramics.",

This scheme uses PHD components to represent each target distribution respectively instead of PHD itself, and track their motions by associating the PHD components between frames, meanwhile alleviating the false tracks by detecting and pruning possible clutter located at the confirmed targets. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PHD tracker has provided more accurate and efficient target trajectory estimating.",

The obtained structural data are typical of amorphous structure. The space location of the chromophores does not change during electric field induced alignment procedure as well as during simulated cooling process. The motion of the polymer chain play the key role in rotation of dopants. The simulated PEK/DR structures were used to compute the optical properties of the chromophore in polymer environment. One may conclude that the local field created by polymer has important value but its anisotropy does not affect the electronic properties of DR molecules. The PEK matrix is neutral for the DR chromophores and may be used to build NLO guest-host composites.",

The most important finding in pool boiling on the graphite-metal composite surfaces is a significant enhancement in performance over that on pure metal surfaces under the same operating conditions.

Results and discussion presented here include pool boiling performance, nucleation phenomena, bubble departure, hysteresis, critical heat flux, and the effects of micro-gravity conditions.

In recent experiments, initially solid tantalum and tungsten samples (50–90 μm thick foils) were uniformly heated in a quasi-isobaric way by a microsecond ion-beam pulses. The temperature of a sample has been observed by a fast multi-channel optical pyrometer during and after the heating. The isobaric heat capacity of the melted metals as well as the enthalpy of fusion have been obtained from the temperature-enthalpy dependence, calculated from measured temperature-time data. A good measurement statistics has been achieved by carrying out a large number of the same experiments with identical targets. The obtained experimental results for liquid tantalum and tungsten heated up to 5000 K are presented and discussed.",

Two independent methods were used to measure a drift mobility of charge carriers in the polymer films. The electric field and temperature dependences of hole and electron mobility were explored. It was also shown that the effect of uniaxial pressure leads to increase both hole and electron mobility. It is concluded that charge carrier transfer in thin polymer films is probably explained by the hopping mechanism through traps.",

Especially in an uncertain air defense battle environment, the decision makers’ knowledge about units that need air protection consists of vagueness. Today’s air defense systems face sophisticated and sudden air threats that are characterized by increasing complexity. While reaction time gets shorter, threat becomes stronger in this new era. This paper aims to present a fuzzy similarity approach to allocate air defense units to deal with the sudden enemy air attacks against friendly units. An allocation system for air threat assessment is investigated based on fuzzy similarity. Firstly, the fuzzy similarity algorithm for deciding air/missile defense units allocation problem will be introduced. Then, appropriate decision makers, criteria and requests of units for air defense will be defined. Finally, the validity of the proposed model will be checked through the obtained results.",

The recently designed VSBL circuit is utilized at the output of the circuit to endow with maximum voltage swing i.e. boosted output voltage from –ve peak to +ve peak vice versa. This boosted voltage swing may be utilized as stabilized supply for distinct purposes. In this way to utilize this augmented circuit, the desired supply is conditioned but leakage power dissipation parameter is not impressive as expected. To improve leakage power dissipation parameter with controlled supply, a lately VSBL cum Schmitt Trigger MOS switches configuration is introduced. This will detract the unwanted leakage power dissipation of the circuit. This functionality exposes the unique performance of the circuit. The entire simulation is carried out at 45 nm (nanometer) technology. It is concluded that the leakage power dissipation is detracted up to 75% approximately and delay performance i.e. speed is improved slightly using Voltage Swing Boost Logic (VSBL) cum Schmitt Trigger MOS switches configuration. In this paper distinct following designs with Analog to Digital converter are represented.",

Because multi-layer laser scanners have a certain elevation angle, there are blind areas that cannot be scanned during the reconstruction process. This paper proposes a full-circle spatial reconstruction system using single-layer laser scanner to solve this problem, and introduces its hardware structure, spatial coordinate algorithm and statistical outlier removal algorithm. To this end, a series of experiments are built to compare with a 16-layer laser scanner, combining the rotating drive structure to reconstruct the space of the room and single objects. The experiments show that the system not only has better completeness of spatial reconstruction effect than 16-layer laser scanner, at the same time, there is no missing detection space, and the cost is much lower than 16-layer laser scanner. The data processing steps such as feature point extraction and outlier removal of the system are all processed by the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier mini-workstation and then the scanning point cloud images are output through the serial port.",

    "abstract": "In some research, it can be necessary to know the categorical data groups to which the data measured by interval and ratio scale belong. The fuzzy sets principle can be used to transform the original continuous data into categories. Fuzzy coding system is used for the transforming. Then, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is proposed to investigate a table where the data are obtained from fuzzy coding. This process is applied for the data collected in many disciplines like biology, ecology, and so on. The aim of this study is to research how the integration of fuzzy coding system and MCA is applied to continuous meteorological data. The triangular membership function is used for transforming the data with this purpose in this application. According to the results, fuzzy coding is more preferable for transforming continuous meterological data into categories because fuzzy coding explains nonlinear relationships better than linear relationships.",

With increase of the deposited layers, the microstructure at the bottom of the repaired zone changed little, but the amount of bainite at the top increased gradually. The microstructure in the substrate zone and heat affected zone (HAZ) was tempered sorbite and tempered martensite, respectively. After heat treatment, the microstructure of laser forming repaired 300M steel tended to be uniform, which consisted of tempered martensite, bainite and a small amount of retained austenite.

Thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) with correction data of density were evaluated for each measurement method, and detailed data are provided in tables. Thermal conductivity of the [001] alloy had a higher trend than that of the [111] alloy, with relative deviation of 0.7% to 4.8%. Coefficient of thermal expansion values showed good agreement (within 5.3%) and had a curve similar to that of the specific heat capacity. All thermophysical property results were described and compared with those of single crystal alloy of CMSX-4, René N5 and conventional cast René 80 of reference data.

Although second-order effects are electric-dipole-forbidden in the bulk of centrosymmetric materials, they become allowed through magneticdipole and electric-quadrupole effects.

Ionic jet impingement on the upper surface of a horizontal plate where boiling is occurring significantly modifies the boiling curve. Heat transfer enhancement has been observed both at saturation temperature and in subcooled conditions, up to a regime of fully-developed nucleate boiling. In addition, the ionic jet is capable of preventing the formation of a vapor film on the boiling surface up to much higher heat fluxes. The working fluids are FC-72 and HFE-7100. Two different high voltage electrodes have been tested: a single pin and an array of 7 points. This novel electrohydrodynamic technique of ionic-jet impingement boiling can greatly increase, with negligible or very low power input, both the heat transfer coefficients on a heated plate and the critical heat flux for the transition to the film boiling regime (up to 160%).",

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing with neuromorphic synaptic elements is an emerging, but very successful approach towards processing and classification of various signals. It can be described as a model of a transient computation, where the influence of input changes the internal dynamics of a chosen computational system. Trajectory of these changes represents computation performed by the system. The selection of a suitable computational substrate capable of non-linear response and rich internal dynamics ensures the implementation of simple readout protocols. Signal evolution based on the rich dynamics of the memristive synapse layer helps to emphasize differences between given signals thus enabling their clustering. Here we present a simple neuromorphic computing system (single node echo-state machine based on the memristive synaptic bridge) implemented on the Multisim platform as a tool for clustering of musical intervals according to their consonant or dissonant character. The system generates a series of “epochs” – images of input signal at different stage of evolution. A readout layer based on peak counting in their Fourier spectra allows clustering of musical intervals in a way similar to human subjects or specialized algorithms. The result of this data evolution closely resembled the sensory dissonance curve, with some significant differences. Interestingly, clustering is performed without any reference to the theory of music. This study shows a high potential for exploiting a simple neuromorphic system for advanced information processing. Furthermore, they indicate that the notions of consonance and dissonance may have the neurophysiological background.",

In addition, decay of the stored energy is presented, the time interval between pump pulses is also determined. In the experiment the amplification results of the fibre amplifier are measured by tuning the width of pump pulse. The repetition rate can be set freely from single shot to 250 Hz.

As Turing-machine like systems, CA are able to perform computation in an abstract and discrete manner. It is clear that CA computational approach can be considered universal so easily applied to numerous different and interdisciplinary fields like the ones of computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, medicine, arts, engineering, communication, cultural heritage, ecology, economy, geology, sociology, just to name a few of their potential application fields.",

The obtained results indicate that the entrance hole diameter increases as the laser pulse frequency, laser power, duty cycle and focal plane position increase; furthermore, by increasing duty cycle and focal plane position, the hole taper decreases. Minimum hole taper, maximum exit diameter, and minimum entrance diameter were considered as optimization criteria.

Problems like fraud detection and illegal activity have risen together with the rising growth of the e-market. The efficacy of the fraud prevention methods of purchases has a significant bearing on the depletion of internet customers. Therefore in this paper, a support vector machine-based fraud detection framework (SVM-FDF) has been proposed for detecting real-time fraud in the e-market. FD framework is implemented to spread prominence from a limited marketing scheme for beginning consumers is invariably used to update their credibility when an offering is applied to the e-market. The comportment features of all existing regular cases and fraud specimens are derived via the clustering algorithm to form the general conduct of the present community of the e-market. Each conduct’s findings demonstrate that the SVM model is employed to evaluate whether all the present transaction is corrupted or fraud. The simulation results show that the suggested SVM- FDF model enhances the precision rate of 98.8%, recall rate of 97.7%, the f1-score ratio of 96.7%, accuracy ratio of 96.8%, and decreases the error rate of 20.9% compared to other existing approaches.",

In the theoretical description this is equivalent to a statement that the observables describing the positions of a particle at the moments preceding the final measurement do not exist. However this does not mean – as it is commonly assumed – that we cannot describe the motion of a quantum particle as a localized entity moving along any specified trajectory. Thus the localization of a quantum particle at every moment is postulated and the indeterministic law of its motion is formulated. The self-interference of a photon in the Mach–Zehnder interferometer serves here to describe the self-interference of a quantum particle. The agreement of this description with the principles of the theory of probability, so far only applied to macroscopic objects, is shown. The result of the simulation of self-interference of a photon within this theory is also presented. Moreover, it is suggested that in this way one can connect both the quantum description and the description of the phenomena in terms of classical physics.",

In certain applications, parts of the circuit are in inactive state and there is the prospect of reconfiguring on-the-fly those parts of the circuit to execute different computations. The reconfigured parts of the circuit can share the same hardware resources by scheduling them into different time slots. However, SRAM-based Multi-Context switches (MC-switches) require a large area. To solve this problem, this paper presents an area-efficient multi-context switch block for MC-FPGAs based on floating-gate-MOS functional pass-gates using multiple/binary valued hybrid signals. By using binary-valued signals, the function of an MC-switch is divided into sub-functions such that each subfunction has only two contexts. A sub-function with two contexts is an up-literal or a down-literal. By using multiple-valued signals, each can be implemented using a single floating-gate-MOS transistor. As result, the proposed MC-switch for four contexts is implemented by only as few as two floating-gate-MOS transistors. Compared to a 32 × 32 SRAM-based multi-context switch block, the transistor count is reduced to 6.8%. The test chip for four contexts is fabricated in a 0.35μm process.",

The planning of the operations of transportation systems is a challenge due to the temporal fluctuations in the demand. Accurate forecasts of the demand in transportation help to plan the resources efficiently as well as increase the service quality. The high degree of uncertainty in the metro transit demand cannot be incorporated into traditional models that have been limited with many assumptions such as linearity. When data are available, machine learning methods provide the ability to use the existing observations to learn the nature of the situation and apply the model to new observations. In this study, we conduct an empirical study to forecast the metro transit demand using a machine learning method, support vector regression. Using the data set of a metro line in city of Istanbul, we apply a SVR model and compare the accuracy of the forecasting with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), quadratic regression and linear regression.",

To address this issue, a bioinspired approach to assess the vulnerability assessment is proposed in this paper. The risk level of the certain area can be obtained through evidence to integrate information from multi-sources. Then, a path with the minimum sum of risk can be determined by a bio-inspired algorithm. sum of the risk level can be seen as a new evaluation index of effectiveness of PPSs. Experimental results of a numerical example demonstrate that the proposed method can handle the vulnerability assessment problem of PPSs efficiently.",

In addition, the multi-degree of freedom (DOF) system model of metal particles was developed to reveal the mechanism of the HFIVSR. The experimental results indicate that the tensile residual stress can be effectively eliminated and homogenized by the HFIVSR. The HFIVSR will not change the microstructure of the materials and there are no considerable changes in the grain size for the S355 steel before and after the HFIVSR; furthermore, the HFIVSR can slow down the lattice distortion energy and thus the tensile residual stresses in the S355 steel specimens can be eliminated.

Such a system should allow various didactic, educational and student styles and is traditionally divided into four modules for analysis and building: Domain Knowledge Base, Tutoring, the Student Interface, and the Student. In particular, the system should adapt to differences between students and the changes in a particular student. One of the main problems when trying to develop an adaptive educational system is that definitions used for instructional design by psychologists and pedagogy experts are vague, while developers work with concrete terms like variables, stochastic values and objects. To make the concept of an adaptive educational system more concrete, this work models the simplest possible adaptive educational system that could exist. The contribution of the paper is that it gives a good description of a basic adaptive educational system and reasons about concrete solutions. The novelty in the paper is that adaptivity occurs in each of the four modules: The system selects an appropriate domain knowledge base model, an appropriate tutoring model, an appropriate (student) Interface model, and an appropriate Student model. Use of these modules will facilitate the design of adaptive educational systems that are educationally effective and will benefit future research and development on adaptive educational systems.",

Meanwhile, the basin tree diagrams of rule 37 are explored for some finite length of binary strings, which reveal its Bernoulli-shift characteristics. It is interesting to find the collisions between propagating pixels of opposite colors in the space-time evolution of rule 37, which can also mimic Dirac’s annihilation of matter and anti-matter.

The specimens were examined by optical and electronic scanning microscopy. A good correlation between the numerical and experimental results concerning the delimitation of the remelted and heat affected zones has been observed. The numerical model is also compared with a numerical model from the literature and good agreement is observed between both theoretical results. Micro hardness measurements were also carried out on transverse sections at the resolidified and heat affected regions.",

A novel method is presented to characterize the power distribution of a focused laser beam by scanning its cross-sectional plane with an optical fibre tip that is commonly used for scanning near field optical microscopy (SNOM). This novel method is capable of characterizing laser beams diverging from very small focal apertures with a high resolution. This method can improve the research and development (R&D) of either an academic institute or a player in the optical industry regarding such things as the development of the next generation of optical storage. In contrast to the established profiling techniques and commercial products, the field of application includes the characterization of beams diverging from the lenses of DVD or BluRay© devices with numerical apertures (NA) in the range of 0.6 up to 0.85. Laser beams emerging from modified optical pickup units (OPU) have been successfully characterized using this novel method.",

    "abstract": "The reaction-diffusion (RD) models describe the change in the behavior of one or more chemical substances through space and time. The RD interaction can create waves of chemical concentration when the chemical systems used are far from equilibrium. The velocity and direction of those waves can be controlled and altered using excitable media or inhibitors. In particular, excitable media are spatially distributed systems characterized by their ability to propagate signals undamped over long distances, while inhibitors are used to reduce the propagation of those signals. The behavior of chemical oscillators are based on such media. The concept of this article is the proposal of a Cellular Automaton (CA) model which exploits the wave propagation characteristics on an excitable medium using inhibitors to create a switching element which is capable of distinguishing two binary states and present a form of amplification, like a basic transistor. In such a sense an unconventional chemical made device with properties similar to the conventional basic element of today’s electronics, namely CMOS transistor is conceived. Furthermore, and in order to properly explore the potential of the proposed device, we design a combination of two of those transistors to prove that they can reproduce Boolean algebra by creating two of the most well known and important component, i.e. the inverter NOT logic gate and the universal logic gate NAND.",

Extremely large and complex systems can have an accordingly large number of threat scenarios, thus simply listing the threats and devising countermeasures for each is ineffective and inefficient. The components of a large system may also have various states of failure, which cannot be captured by contemporary binary system models. To address this problem, we describe a threat cataloging methodology whereby a large number of threats can be efficiently cataloged and analyzed for common features. This allows countermeasures to be formulated that address a large number of threats that share common features. The methodology utilizes Mixed-Radix Multiple-Valued Logic for describing the state of a large system and a multiple-valued decision diagram (MDD) for the threat catalog and analysis.",

By utilizing the attractive features of MTJ device such as non-volatility and 3D stack ability, post-process-oriented tuning mechanism can be implemented with a small area penalty. Additionally, multiple-valued resistance obtained by series-parallel connections of MTJ devices allows more precise tuning of the operating point in the proposed MTJ-based basic component. The use of the proposed mechanism relaxes the constraints on the design margin, which enables to broaden the variety of circuit topologies available for high-performance, low-power and highly reliable VLSI implementation. An experimental design of a new MTJ-based differential comparator with a parameter-tunable capability shows that the use of the proposed multiple-valued resistance achieves 79.6% reduction of the variation effect for the input-output characteristic. Moreover, a design of a tunable operational trans conductance amplifier (OTA) based on the proposed technique and its performance improvement is also demonstrated.",

A novel method of the fringe spacing measurement is introduced based on digital image processing. Meanwhile, the theoretical displacement distribution is calculated according to the numerical solutions of beams deflection curve. Numerical simulations are also carried out by finite element software ANSYS. The experimental results conform to the theoretical analysis completely; therefore, a new method to solve the problem of displacement measurement of cantilever beam is provided.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the research we conducted was to establish reliable correlations between the input parameters and the parameters of laser wire cladding quality used in optimization. Using a Nd:YAG laser as the energy source, laser wire cladding was carried out on the seven most frequently used tool steels (1.2311, 1.2312, 1.2343, 1.2344, 1.2767, 1.2379 and 1.2550). The quality of a laser wire clad-weld was defined by their geometrical characteristics, mechanical properties and minimum internal stresses in the area of the laser wire clad-weld. The importance of the general correlations between the laser wire cladding parameters were determined by means of a statistical factor analysis, which provides factor loadings with the variables. The laser wire cladding analysis was carried out through the purposeful selection of control parameters and monitoring of the laser wire clad-weld quality parameters. The results obtained and the laser wire cladding research procedure we used provide a suitable tool for attaining the desired laser wire clad-weld quality and can be used by laser wire cladding designers and technologists.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews critically the pulse shortening mechanisms of nanosecond to zeptosecond lasers and reports successful operation of multicolor distributed feedback dye laser. To demonstrate multicolor tunable ultrashort pulse generation a dye solution of Rhodamine 6G in ethanol may be pumped by four pairs of amplitude phase divided or wavefront divided second harmonic of a passively Q.switched or Q.switched and mode-locked Nd:YAG laser. The picosecond pump pulses, through coherence effects and resonant Bragg scattering, generate subpicosecond tunable multicolor laser lines. The number of laser lines increased linearly by increasing the pump laser pulses and reducing the mutual delays among the pump pulses. Normal interferences of two pulses at dye cell produces one laser line but pumping by multiple pump pulses produces a contemporary discrete supercontinuum of ultrashort laser pulses. Streak camera measurement shows that the number of laser lines vary from nine to thirteen for three to four pairs of pump pulses. The pulse lengths vary from 10 ps down to some unknown femtoseconds that could not be assessed accurately because of the 5ps measurement resolution limitation of the Imacon 674 Streak Camera. Experimental results on time delayed ultrashort pulses interference in dye cell have lead to the possibility of 13-color simultaneous attosecond pulses generation through autocorrelation of several closely spaced concurrent pulses from a distributed feedback dye laser.",

During the printing process, the meltpool is created, which controls the build parts’ microstructure and quality. So, it is crucial to determine the meltpool size and establish the effect of process parameters on the meltpool dimensions. An analytical approach is utilized to determine the meltpool size. These predicted data from the analytical approach were validated with experimental data. Inconel 718 powder was used to fabricate the cubed shaped samples with a combination of different SLM process parameters; namely, laser power; scanning speed; and hatching space. Meltpool dimensions were measured from the microstructure images of the samples. After the validation of analytical data with experimental data, the effect of SLM process parameters on meltpool dimensions was established. The result shows that the SLM process parameters significantly affects meltpool geometry, which is very useful for selecting suitable process parameters.",

OCT has been extensively used for early diagnose of ocular disease by obtaining two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) images. Using OCT with a superluminescent diode (SLD) laser with a wavelength, λ, of 840 nm we identified problems in the retina and optic nerve. OCT data set images were obtained from Sankara Nethralaya (SN) Eye Hospital, Chennai, India using a high-definition (HD)-OCT machine with a scan length of 2 mm and a raster scan protocol containing 512 × 1024 pixels for the identification of ocular diseases such as macular hole (MH), diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and central serous retinopathy (CSR) for different patients of different ages. These images were processed using two different software packages: optical coherence tomography segmentation and evaluation (OCTSEG); and graphical interface for medical image analysis and simulation (GIMIAS) for further identification of fluid accumulation, vessel collapse, layer breakage and fluid drainage. OCTSEG was used to identify and separate different five layers. Each layer has been distinguished with colour. GIMIAS was used to colourize OCT images which can help us to observe and diagnose different problems in the layers. Each colourization has different benefit. Using this software, different area of a diseased eye can be easily detected. Finally, the comparison of three types of images made this diagnosis easier and clear.",

    "abstract": "Seed injection is an important technology in single longitude mode laser for Doppler wind lidar (DWL). Different methods of seed injection lead to difference of anti-jamming of the system. For mobile and airborne wind lidar, vibration influences the frequency stability of laser, which results in frequency jitter and larger errors in wind measurements. The frequency stability of locked lasers with the technology of build-up time minimization and ramp-fire technology are investigated respectively to compare the dependence of frequency stability on vibration. Results show that the frequency-locked 532 nm pulsed laser with ramp-fire technology has frequency stability of less than 5.00 MHz under vibration condition, while the frequency stability of the laser with build-up time minimization technology reaches up to 9.00 MHz. This suggests that the laser with ramp-fire technology is more suitable than laser with built-up time minimization technology for DWL used in the vibration environment.",

Development of power-efficient solutions like energy efficient designs of network, less power consuming protocols etc in telecom networks have become very necessary for achieving the reduction in acute power consumption of the globe happening due to ICT equipment. As per noting of the power consumption scrutinizers, the Optical networks have been reported as dominant contributor in the overall power consumption as it carries the huge amount of data onto the various networks. The failure of network of minute results as a huge loss of data. To overcome the issue of power consumption it is also necessary to look into the usage of redundant resources of the network. However, these redundant resources are also a large scale donor in overall power consumption. From the above discussion, it is evident that there is an urgent need to consider minimizing power consumption of optical networks and assuring survivability of network at the same time. To protect an optical network the concept of p-Cycles (Pre-Configured Cycles) are one of the advancing technique. Unlike dedicated protection techniques, the p-Cycles have combined advantage of fast restoration speed and efficiency in addition to other benefits. For more number of p-cycle the network solution takes more resolving time. Therefore a new heuristic was developed to resolve the NP hard problem. Such type of p-cycles is called as power efficient pre configured cycle (PEP-cycle).",

In order to solve the problem that the planar array CCD has low detection accuracy due to the limitation of sampling density during conventional imaging. The sampling density of the tool setting diffraction image is improved by using the planar array CCD staggered imaging technique in this paper, detailed methods are as follows: The single planar array CCD is integrally shifted by the combination of the nano-lifting platform and the high precision two-dimensional (2-D) translation stage, is used to image the tool setting gap with a certain object distance. And then, four diffraction-strip images with complementary information are obtained, which we can use to stitch the image information according to the translocation relationship between each image, and finally a higher resolution diffraction image is obtained. Through detecting the distance between the light intensity peak points of the first-order diffraction fringes of higher resolution diffraction image, the detection precision of the tool setting gap of laser diffraction is improved 50 to 70 μm. The results indicate that the detection precision of tool setting gap can be improved effectively by increasing the image sampling density with the planar CCD staggered imaging technology.",

Moreover, parallelism of weighted spiking neural P systems with rules on synapses allows the system to perform a space-time trade-off, and it helps the system to factorize large integers in linear time.",

To counter such limitations, a novel approach was proposed based on multi-temporal scans, whose kernel relies on the use of a three-dimensional (3-D) matching algorithm to track and estimate the deformation of each analysis object (such as rocks) selected on the landslide, and mainly involves three steps: the acquisition of multi-period scans; the co-registration of the scanned data; and the parameter estimation based on local object matching. Due to this approach can adequately take advantage of the large redundancy in point clouds, it has the capability to provide precisely 3-D change information, including displacement and rotation, and has a high degree of flexibility that can be widely applied. By a simulation experiment, the performance of the approach was verified and some meaningful results were achieved: in case of scanning targets at a distance of 220 m, the estimated displacement errors are approximate 1 cm, the rotary errors are below 0.9°; the corresponding errors increase with the distance changed to 400 m. Additionally, following this approach a practical monitoring case of landslide was briefly analysed, and the analysis results further verified the findings obtained in the designed experiment.",

Information integration is in this case quantified by applying the information-theoretic measure known as total correlation to the long-run distribution of CA states. Total correlation is the amount by which the total uncertainty associated with cell states surpasses the uncertainty of the CA state taken as a whole. It is an emergent property, in the sense that it can only be ascribed to how the cells interact with one another, and has been linked to the rise of consciousness in the brain. We investigate total correlation in the evolution of elementary CA for all update rules that are unique with respect to negation or reflection. For each rule we consider the usual, deterministic CA behavior, assuming that the initial state is chosen uniformly at random, and also the probabilistic variant in which every cell, at all time steps and independently of all others, disobeys the rule’s prescription with a fixed probability. We have found rules that generate as much total correlation as possible, or nearly so, particularly in Wolfram classes 2 and 3. We conjecture that some of these rules can be used as CA models of information integration.",

MRDE algorithm has been tested on benchmark functions and has proven its performance. To test the performance of on real world application MR-DE is applied in test case generation problem and proved to better than PSO–TVAC algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Ultrafast laser machining is a unique technique to fabricate nano- and microscale structures with limited distortion to substrate materials. In the present work the influence of laser beam polarization direction on micromachining of crystalline Si with ultrafast laser pulses has been reported. The geometry of hole, ablation depth, machined features, kerf width and edge quality are studied with respect to the state of polarization. In terms of hole geometry, machining with S-polarized beam generates nearly circular holes as compared to asymmetrical stretching of the holes machined with P-polarization. Moreover, the depth of holes and channels machined with P-polarized beam is higher when compared to the depths of features machined with S-polarized beam. In multi-pulse, ultrafast laser machining, absorption of incident radiation is highly dependent on state of laser polarization and angle of incidence after first few pulses. The absorption is significantly higher for P-polarized beam resulting greater ablation depths. It is apparent from the experimental results that state of laser polarization is an important parameter in micromachining of semiconductors with ultrafast laser pulses under ambient condition.",

The ignition characteristics of the laser plasma and its propagation speed of the laser-supported absorption wave, which developed into the blast wave, were analysed primarily. The results show that the flow field propagated, without any constraint, in the shape of an ellipse. Obvious reflection and diffraction of the blast wave occurred at the edges for the plate target and the 15 expanding target constraint. A slowly changing low-density and a high-pressure air mass appeared for all three constraints. When the laser-supported detonation wave developed into a blast wave, the propagation speed dropped abruptly and reached the speed of sound in about 70~80 microsecond.",

Using DRAM, many advanced processors now on chip instructions and data memory. But major contribution of power dissipation in DRAM cell is off-state leakage current. The main motive of the present paper is to reduce the consumption of power as well as to reduce the leakage of current and leakage of power. 3T1D is a non-destructive read DRAM cell with three transistors (T) and a gated diode (D) which acts as a storage device and an amplifier. Here, three circuits of DRAM (such as 3T DRAM cell, 4T DRAM Cell, and 3T1D DRAM cell) have been taken and comparison among them was observed which resulted that 3T1D DRAM cell offers faster read speed and less read leakage current than conventional 3T DRAM and 4T DRAM. The average power consumed by 3T1D in nW (nano Watt) whereas 3T DRAM and 4T DRAM in micro Watt. 3T1D offers 36% less leakage current than 4T DRAM and 77% less leakage current than 3T DRAM.

    "abstract": "Microscale laser dynamic flexible forming (μLDFF) is a new kind of high velocity forming (HVF) process, in which the desired microfeatures can be obtained under the action of laser shock. The forming depth of workpiece depends primarily on laser power density, so the high laser power density is used to form deep microfeatures. The fracture will occur when the forming velocity imparted by the high power density exceeds the critical forming velocity. To overcome this problem, single pulse µLDFF is extended to multi-pulse µLDFF in this work, and multipulse free forming experiments were carried out. The forming depth increases with the number of laser shocks, and the first laser shock make a major contribution to the total forming depth. The roughness of the unconstrained surfaces increases with the number of laser shocks. A three-dimensional (3-D) finite element method (FEM) model is also built to simulate the multiple laser shocking process, and the predicted 3-D surface morphology are compared with the experimental results to validate the accuracy of the simulation model. The 3-D comparisons results indicate that geometric inaccuracy occurs, which may be due to multiple shocks of the high velocity air flow induced by the high velocity deformation of workpiece under atmospheric condition. In addition, the unconstrained surface roughening may, in turn, affect the geometry of workpiece. With the increase of the times of laser shocks, the loading mode varies from plane/plane impact to curved surface/curved surface impact. The deformation behaviours of workpiece under the different loading modes are characterized.",

In addition, we explore the role of adsorption-induced conformation or orientation changes, and demonstrate that this model can accommodate volume invariant shape changes but not volume variant shape changes. The molecular volume can be applied to non-spherical molecules such as fibrinogen and captures differences between BSA, multi-layer, and HSA, monolayer, adsorption. These findings confirm the importance of the solvent in protein adsorption, elucidate the importance of molecular volume on surface tension change, and suggest that this model is generally applicable.",

    "abstract": "The laser microdrilling of via holes in Si semiconductor wafers was studied using 1 ms pulses from an Yb fibre laser with 1070 nm wavelength. Optical microscopy and cross‑sectional analysis were used to quantify hole dimensions, the distribution of recast material and any microcracking for both (100) and (111) single crystal surface semiconductor wafer orientations. The flexibility of this laser wavelength and simple pulsing scheme were demonstrated for a range of semiconductor substrates of narrow and wide bandgap including InSb, GaSb, InAs, GaAs, InP and sapphire. Detailed observations for Si showed that, between the threshold energies for surface melting and the irradiance for drilling a “thru” hole from the front surface to rear surface, there was a range of irradiances for which microcracking occurred near the hole circumference. The directionality and lengths of these microcracks were studied for the (100) and (111) orientations and possible mechanisms for formation were discussed, including the Griffith criterion for microcracks and the failure mechanism of fatigue usually applied to welding of metals. Above the irradiance for formation of a thru hole, few cracks were observed. Future work will compare similar observations and measurements in other narrow- and wide-bandgap semiconductor wafer substrates.",

The effect of directional Lorentz force generated by electromagnetic field on the discharge of the molten metal in laser processing is investigated and the correspond- ing experiment is carried out. First, based on the orthogonal experiment, the effects of laser power, scanning speed, magnetic field intensity and current density on the groove forming are analysed qualitatively. Then the Box-Behnken experimental scheme is used to supplement the experimental samples, and the back propagation (BP) neural network is applied to establish the quantitative computation model of process parameters and groove morphology characteristics. The experimental results reveal that scanning speed and laser power have greater influence on the groove depth, scanning speed and magnetic field intensity have larger influence on the upper groove width, and scanning power and laser power have greater influence on the lower groove width. The process parameter model based on BP neural network can conveniently analyse the electromagnetic field-assisted laser groove forming process.",

In some domains, including oral reading, assessing the proficiency of a student is a challenging task for a computer. Our approach for assessing student reading proficiency is to use data that a computer tutor collects through its interactions with a student to estimate his performance on a human-administered test of oral reading fluency. A model with data collected from the tutor’s speech recognizer output correlated, within-grade, at 0.78 on average with student performance on the fluency test. For assessing students, data from the speech recognizer were more useful than student help-seeking behavior. However, adding help-seeking behavior increased the average within-grade correlation to 0.83. These results show that speech recognition is a powerful source of data about student performance, particularly for reading.",

Welding speed (1 to 5 mm/s), TIG current (90 to 130 A) and distance of heat sources (1 to 5 mm) were assumed as the input process variables while the weld surface width, weld seam area, and weld penetration were considered as the process responses. Analysed by statistical techniques, the results indicated that the welding speed is the most important parameter among all parameters with a reverse effect on process outputs. Besides, TIG current has a direct influence on all investigated responses. The paper invokes the desirability approach optimization technique to achieve the best geometrical dimensions of weld profiles and validating the theoretical results using the experimental tests. Once the optimum settings are considered, a tensile test was also conducted.",

    "abstract": "In bone tissue engineering the use of lasers is increasing continuously because of its ability to fabricate the minute details of the structure which require cells to adhere, migrate and proliferate. The important properties that a scaffold should contain are biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, bioactivity, and porosity. In bone tissue engineering, the architectural design as well as porosity design of the scaffold plays a very important role as it directly provides homing to the bone cells to live, migrate and proliferate, and to bind with host tissues. The tailored porosity in the material is still a challenging task; however, this can be taken care of by the use of lasers in the scaffold fabrication. Herein is an up to date perspective of the significance of lasers and laser parameters in fabricating the tailored scaffolds with different materials like metals, polymers, ceramics and composite biomaterial for bone tissue engineering application. The problem of low adherence of cells on the metals and polymers is been solved by the lasers by increasing the grooves, surface roughness and wettability. The ceramics and composites are also successfully fabricated with controlled porosity by modulating laser parameters. This review will guide the researcher in bone tissue engineering area with different materials and fabrication of the porous architectural design.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the 21st century, outsourcing has become an important strategic decision for firms that want to turn to their core competencies, to reduce logistics costs and to increase customer satisfaction. Owing to fact that outsourcing generally is encountered at logistics activities, third party logistics (TPL) providers play an important role in the success of the supply chain and the firm. For this reason, TPL provider selection has become a strategic decision making problem for firms and supply chain. Therefore, in this paper, a decision making procedure is presented for selection among third-party logistics providers based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) that is a stronger way than fuzzy set theory to express the uncertainty. Furthermore, a group dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (DIFTOPSIS) method is proposed for selecting the most appropriate TPL provider under uncertainty and in different time periods. This method is developed to enable the evaluation of the alternatives in different periods and its steps are presented for the application of a TPL provider selection problem. The proposed method is applied to a selection problem of two cargo companies for a firm which produces electrical radiator and wants to sale its products on the internet.",

It is well known that the effectiveness of teachers is a function of content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge. Indeed, there are few opportunities for beginning teachers to practice their craft and to observe the practice of others. In this paper, we describe the methodology of Bringing Evidence-based Assessment to Mathematics and Science (BEAMS). BEAMS seeks to address these needs by focusing on diagnostic and formative assessment, as well as supporting deep mathematical understanding, within the curriculum of teacher education institutions for elementary education pre-service teachers. We introduce the idea of a data organizer that will help teachers formatively design lessons by aggregating information about student performance and by tracking student learning over a period of time. Using this methodology opens a door for teachers to improve their students’ performance in new ways.",

The main argument was the fact that a magnetic flux or flux-linkage in the definition of an ideal memristor was not completely correct not deriving from Maxwell equations. The next important question arises then: ‘What could be a memristor with physically correct term of flux in its definition?’ Here, we suggest the possible answer to this question based on Maxwell equations with recovered hidden symmetry, i.e. with the magnetic monopoles in their structure. Memristance is likely not a resistance with memory but some kind of the dielectric characteristic of a medium surrounding the circuit. It is suggested to consider the memristor simply as an electrically variable resistor with possibility to hold its current resistive state under zero or some constant voltage bias (memory effect).",

    "abstract": "Sensory evaluation is a process that involves knowledge acquired via human senses. Generally, sensory evaluation processes are defined in unbalanced contexts because these are focused on one side of the scale used to collect sensory information. The olive oil sensory evaluation is defined in this kind of context to establish the quality of the olive oil, being the quality a key factor in its marketing. The international olive council established three quality categories and a quantitative method based on statistical analysis to classify a olive oil sample. The perceptions in sensory evaluation processes involves imprecision and uncertainty that has a non-probabilistic nature. Therefore, the use of the fuzzy linguistic approach for modeling and managing can provide successful results in such processes. This paper presents a fuzzy linguistic sensory evaluation model that uses an unbalanced linguistic scale in order to classify olive oil and its validation. The validation process has involved taster panels that choose and validate the unbalanced linguistic scale to measure the intensity of each sensory feature and classify olive oil, using an unbalanced linguistic scale. Finally, a software prototype that was developed to carry out the classification of olive oil samples with the fuzzy linguistic sensory evaluation model is also presented.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on “Tyres and Tyre related wastes”. End of Life Tyres (ELT) are detected according to waste and waste disposal regulations. Many studies have been conducted in different countries in order to determine the most suitable ELT recovery method. The aim of this study is to make an ELT disposal method selection, considering current conditions. It proposes a two-step methodology. Considering the lack of quantitative data and the presence of qualitative perspectives, the selection has been made using a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool named Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). To handle the imprecise nature of the expert judgments, the study proceeds by using the fuzzy extended AHP. The second step consists of making a distinction between some alternatives determined by experts.These alternatives are evaluated according to quantitative and qualitative data through fuzzy goal programming method in order to find out the percentages of ELT that must be used for each of them.",

Regular manual monitoring is time-consuming and laborious, and the information lags behind. In order to collect building information in real time and quickly, this paper briefly introduced Three-dimensional laser scanning technology, and combined building information modeling (BIM) to collect and monitor building information. Then, an operational steel suspension bridge in Shaanxi Province, China, was analyzed by using three-dimensional laser BIM technology, and the actual data measured by high-precision total station was used for comparison. The results showed that the trend of deformation and displacement data collected by both static monitoring and dynamic monitoring was basically the same, and the deformation and displacement of suspension bridge increased gradually from both ends to the middle, reaching the maximum at 50 m; statistical data of all monitoring points showed that the accuracy of short-time static monitoring of three-dimensional laser BIM was 97.2%, and that of long-time dynamic monitoring was 95.3%. In conclusion, three-dimensional laser BIM technology can be used for building modeling and information data acquisition and monitoring.",

In addition, a sufficient and necessary condition for credibility function is proved, which provides an equivalent axiomatic definition for credibility value. The problem of credibilistic satisfiability is proposed to verify the consistency of a set of credibility values for formulas, and an algorithm is designed to solve this problem. Furthermore, for a set of consistent credibility values for formulas, the problem of credibilistic entailment is proposed to estimate the credibility value of an additional formula. In order to solve this problem, several nonlinear optimization models are designed by applying the maximum entropy principle, minimum cross-entropy principle and so on. Finally, as an application of credibilistic satisfiability and credibilistic entailment, a simplified example concerning the problem of position estimation of a mobile robot is shown.",

An as-cast nickel-based superalloy used for manufacturing blisks and vanes in advanced gas turbines was used in the present work. A Yb-doped fibre laser having 1080 μm wavelength operated in continuous wave mode was used to laser treat the surface of the test material to modify the microstructure across the treated depth. The laser beam scan parameters were optimized through pilot experiments and the surface is treated in parallel tracks having 30% overlap. The cross-section of the treated samples was studied to understand the volume fraction of grain refinement. A finely refined microstructure was observed across the treated depth and their morphology varies with the different combination of laser power and scan speed. The combination of higher laser power with reduced interaction time imparts finely refined equiaxed grain structure near the top surface and columnar grains having reduced primary arm spacing near the bottom of the treated depth. This imparts higher surface hardness near the surface which reduces linearly towards the treated depth. The effect of laser surface treatment in improving the oxidation and corrosion resistance was analysed. The samples were tested at 1100 and 800°C in a muffle furnace to study the high temperature oxidation and corrosion behaviour of the nickel-based superalloy base and treated surfaces. For high temperature corrosion testing the samples were coated with a thin film of 40%Na",

    "abstract": "Two Invar steel plates with a thickness of 19.05 mm were welded by laser-metal active gas (MAG) hybrid welding technique using the Invar M93 solder wire. Three contrast experiments were conducted to analyse the influences of processing parameters on surface morphology, weld width and penetration. The hybrid welding processing parameters which preliminarily identified were optimized. The experiments results illustrate that the 19.05 mm thick Invar steel welding, should be completed at least three layers weld welding and using Technique 1 can get qualified welding joint. Meanwhile, the heat input of weld bead centre is dominated by laser, the fusion and crystallization speed is very high, the grain is refined and equiaxial line appeared. While the heat input of area where deviated from centre depends on arc, columnar line appeared in this area.",

    "abstract": "Animal models have shown that coupling ligands, targeted to endothelium surface receptors, with drug delivery carriers (DD C) can optimize the treatment of diseases by specific vascular delivery. The endothelium is exposed to hydrodynamic forces that modulate the expression of these cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) and affect the structural and biological activity of endothelial cells (ECs). In order to investigate how delivery of targeted DDC can be optimized, we investigated carriers binding to flow adapted ECs under flow conditions. Comparison of live ECs to fixed cells from our previous experiments give insight into the effect of receptor motility on the cell surface as well as the effect of other factors such as glycocalyx (a protective layer of carbohydrates on the surface of cells) and actin remodeling. A flow chamber model is used to investigate how DDC size variation alters binding under flow conditions. Binding experiments were done with and without glycocalyx in order to elucidate its protective effect. Using fluorescence microscopy we determined the real time binding and rolling speeds of DD C under flow conditions. We also demonstrate the presence of glycocalyx and image actin filament remodeling. The binding of 1 μm carriers to ECs decreased after flow adaptation, in both non-activated and TNF-α activated ECs compared to non-flow adapted live cells. After removal of the glycocalyx by degrading enzymes binding increased in quiescent ECs, but only increased in activated cells after 2 hr of perfusion with particles. The binding with 100 nm carriers also decreased after flow adaptation but to a lesser extent and partially increased after enzyme degradation. These experiments give insight as to how tunable affinity parameters can be optimized to enhance therapeutic capabilities.",

The recent successful standardization of broadband power line communication (PLC) through IEEE 1901, ITUT G.9960/61 and visible light communication (VLC) through IEEE 802.15.7 leads one to consider their integration. On the one hand, the existing infrastructure of PLC can greatly reduce the cost of integrated VLC-PLC system. On the other hand, it is highly beneficial to use laser diodes or light emitting diodes (LEDs) for data communication while exploiting these optical transmitters for illumination at the same time. Similar to Wi-Fi, which uses Ethernet connections as the backbone network, VLC may be a good complementary indoor wireless communication system using PLC as the backbone network. In this paper, integration of VLC with existing PLC network is proposed. The system consists of non-directed optical access point with an LED array transmitter and a Si-based photodiode (PD) receiver. The work investigates the possibility of introducing statistical hybrid VLC-PLC channel, modulation and their integration. This VLC-PLC system is then analysed in terms of connectivity, range, and the waveform distortion; moreover, the use of optical filter has been intelligently used to increase the connectivity range of VLC transceiver.",

The problem is challenging in CA as individual cells only possess information about their own and local neighbour states. The problem is an exercise in the propagation and processing of information within a distributed computational medium. We explore whether the Majority Problem can be approximated in a similarly simple distributed computing substrate — a multi-agent model of slime mould. An initial pattern of discrete voting choices is represented by spatial arrangement of the agent population, temporarily held in-place by an attractant stimulus. When this stimulus is removed the model adapts its shape and size, moving to form a minimal distance connecting line. The final position of this line is shown—in simple examples—to successfully represent the majority vote decision, and also accurately reflects the size of the majority. We note properties, limitations and potential improvements to the approach before returning ‘full-circle’ by re-encoding this morphological adaptation approach in a simple (and more space efficient) 1D CA model.",

Simulation-based approaches can be applied to larger networks, however, they are incomplete. We present an algorithm which uses a SAT-based bounded model checking approach to find all attractors in a multiple-valued network. The efficiency of the presented algorithm is evaluated by analyzing 30 network models of real biological processes as well as 35.000 randomly generated 4-valued networks.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose the use of fuzzy logic for dynamic parameter adaptation in the Multiverse Optimizer algorithm. For this study, we use the typical unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions for comparing results with respect to the original algorithm, and for the control problems, we use some benchmark fuzzy controllers. In the systems that were studied, first we use a problem that involves system identification, this is the case of the tipper problem, which is compared with the original algorithm; then, we proceed to use some control problems, one is cruise control, which focuses on achieving a desired speed on a vehicle with a certain weight; from here, we use the temperature control in a shower, which controls the temperature of the water by adjusting the water valves, another control problem is the inverted pendulum, which is one of the most common test control problems used for optimization in fuzzy logic controllers. The last control problem is the autonomous mobile robot, which consists in controlling the direction of the robot by adjusting the torque on its wheels. In all of these problems we optimize the membership functions for fuzzy controllers. The main goal of this study is to analyze whether Fuzzy Logic can improve the Multiverse Optimizer performance in certain cases by dynamically adjusting some parameters of the algorithm so it can be more competitive on more complex problems.",

    "abstract": "A primary dendrite identification method based on deep learning is proposed. The primary dendrite identification is an important part of laser cladding surface performance test which is the base of mechanical properties research. Traditional primary dendrite identification depends primarily on artificial vision detection. With the rapid development of deep learning, industrial automatic detection has become an inevitable trend, because deep learning technology can greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency, therefore, the study of primary dendrite automatic detection technology has great practical value. In this paper, the semantic segmentation neural network in deep learning is used to label the primary dendrite by using only small-scale dataset training the neural network. The semantic segmentation neural network is constructed based on the improved U-Net structure. The experimental results show that after training, the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) index of the test set results is 0.789, and manual recognition takes about 18 times longer than deep learning.",

    "abstract": "A multi-gate OTA using substrate-biasing and quasi-cascode compensation has been demonstrated in this research paper. The quasi-cascode compensation provides a current-adaptive design of multi-gate OTA which ensures high stability by improving phase shift. In this research paper along with the quasi-cascode compensation substrate-biasing technique is also anticipated which maximizes the gain of the multi-gate OTA. The methodology discussed does not affect the output-voltage fluctuation and consumes minimum power. In this research paper OTA is designed by using multi-gate technology and four multi-gate OTA models are presented by applying the anticipated substrate-biasing and quasi-cascode compensation which operate at 0.8V power supply in a 45nm process. The obtained results are compared with previously proposed conventional miller compensation circuit. The aspect ratio of all the transistors used in the multi-gate OTA is equal in size [9]. The miller capacitance used in all the anticipated design is same. The result achieved after simulation of the anticipated models of multi-gate OTA (makes use of both the substrate-biasing technique and Quasi-cascode compensation) clearly verifies that the gain is increased by a factor of 5(14dB), the gain-bandwidth product frequency is enhanced by 50 % as compared to the previously proposed conventional miller-compensation circuits. The phase-margin of the proposed multi-gate OTA has maintained a constant phase margin for multi-gate two stage operational amplifier by varying in its bias current by a factor of 500 (5 to 2500 nA). The Opamp circuit is designed in 45nm CMOS technology and for the result and simulation the proposed design is simulated in Cadence Virtuoso tool with 0.8V power supply.",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic detection of radio frequency identification (RFID) system, the structure distribution of the tags has an important influence on the reading distance of RFID tags. In order to analyse the influence of tag structure distribution on tag reading distance, this paper proposes a method for optimal distribution of the three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate structure of the tags based on laser ranging and Grey neural network (GNN). Firstly, a dynamic performance test system based on laser ranging is adopted. Then, by using the dynamic performance test system, the reading distance of different tag 3-D structure distribution is obtained. Finally, in view of the nonlinear relationship between the 3-D structure distribution of the tags and the corresponding reading distance, the GNN model is used to model this nonlinear relationship. The established model is used to predict the reading distance of the tags’ 3-D structure distribution. Experimental results show that compared with genetic algorithm-back propagation (GA-BP) neural network, particle swarm optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) neural network and support vector machine (SVM), the GNN method proposed in this paper can more accurately predict the reading distances of tags’ 3-D structures. The prediction error values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are 0.0469, 0.0258, and 0.0402, respectively.

A person enters a private pension plan on a purely voluntary basis, makes regular investments into a fund and is free to choose out of a set of investment alternatives. The amount of savings produced during the accumulation phase depends solely on the level of contributions and the riskiness of the investment portfolio chosen. When the person becomes eligible for a pension, he may draw the fund in a lump sum, he may invest all or part of his savings to buy a life annuity or may choose to invest or consume it in any other way he desires. Welfare at retirement depends highly on the capability of the individual to correctly match his decisions during the accumulation phase with his expectations in retirement. He has to evaluate correctly the sufficiency of the fund at hand, follow a prudent spending policy so that he is not out of money at late retirement. Concepts such as the riskiness of the portfolio, the sufficiency of the money at hand or the evaluation of longevity are fuzzy concepts and may be better defined as “low”, “medium” or “high” rather than with exact numerical values. We try to give the basic notions of the retirement problem by fuzzifying the level of contributions, the investment rate of return and life length, trying to create a series of “possible” outcomes depending on a range of decisions of the individual to show the way towards prudent decisions.",

Considering the complex structure and tedious determination procedures of water-in-oil emulsions-based problems, old regression models are not able to capture the nonlinear relationships existing between variables in a complex water-in-oil emulsion system. To undertake these tasks, derivation of a motivation for developing a robust and reliable model has become a particular field of investigation to predict a proper stability index due the involved uncertainties and their poor generalization performance. Recently, it has become apparent that alternative artificial intelligence-based methods, such as fuzzy logic methodology, have been successfully used to deal with subjects having ambiguities and uncertainties. In this study, a MISO (multiple inputs and single output) fuzzy-logic-based model was proposed as a new numerical modeling scheme for the prediction of water-in-oil emulsions formation. The fuzzy-logic predictions were compared to the actual data from some common oils and against a 15-term old regression model. Statistical results clearly indicated that, compared to the regression approach, the proposed MISO fuzzy-logic-based model showed a superior predictive performance on forecasting of water-in-oil emulsions stability with a satisfactory determination coefficient over 0.98.",

Under the H-V 5/7 atmospheric turbulence model, performances the relay mirror system with the sources composed of different number of coherent beams are calculated. Results show that the optimal configuration of the relay mirror system using 3.8 mm laser is an array composed of 6 coherent beams, the optimal configuration of the relay mirror system using 1.315 mm laser and 1.064 mm laser is an array composed of seven coherent beams.",

Whereas the weld bead profiles show complete penetration irrespective of welding speed, the microstructures of fusion zones differ. The aspect ratio of fusion zone is found to be higher at lower welding speeds. This is due to enhanced heat input which results in increase in average grain size and formation of columnar dendritic structure in the weld zones. The tensile strength and microhardness of the laser welded joints are higher than the base alloy.",

Combining with the performance requirements of moulds, the laser cladding process parameters were optimized with the coating surface hardness as the goal. The optimized process parameters were laser power, powder feeding rate and scanning speed. 20 runs of cladding tests were carried out based on the central composite design method. Using Design-Expert software, the hardness-process parameter objective function model was obtained, and the reliability of the model was verified. The cladding process parameters were optimized based on the response surface method. It was found that the optimal ranges of laser power were 1600 to 2100 W, scanning speed were 9.5 to 13.0 mm/s and powder feeding rate were 24.0 to 34.0 g/min. This conclusion showed that the coating could reach the hardness index of cold work die steel.",

    "abstract": "With the recent surge of microblogging services, such as Twitter and Sina Weibo, huge digital footprints of the user’s profiles, tweets and comments, and online social interactions become accessible to service providers. Unlike social networks (e.g., Facebook, Flickr) that have explicit groups for users to subscribe to or join, microblogs usually have no explicit community structures. In order to capitalize on the large number of potential users, quality community detection and profiling approaches are needed. In the meantime, the diversity of users’ interests and behaviors when using microblogs suggests that their community structures overlap. In this paper, based on the user’s online social interactions (e.g., tweeting, retweeting) and textual information (e.g., tweets, retweets), we come out with a novel topic-aware and interaction-centric hypergraph clustering approach to discover and profile the overlapping communities of microblog users. By employing both pairwise and triadic hyperedges, the proposed framework is not only able to group like-minded users from different social perspectives but also discover communities with explicit profiles indicating the interests of community members. The efficacy of our approach is validated by intensive empirical evaluations using the collected Sina Weibo dataset.",

The longest period for molten silicon to solidify were amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films, 50 nm and 90 nm thick. They took 480 ns and 711 ns, respectively. The diameter of the disk grain in the lateral growth regime was as large as 3 µm with excellent crystallinity and was accomplished by a single-shot of XeF excimer laser irradiation with a 90 nm-thick a-Si thin film at a substrate temperature of 500 &Mac176;C.",

A non-linear second order response (NLO) has been found in the acentric crystals of few of the 4-nitropyridine N-oxides. In a newly synthesized series of PNO derivatives, called nitraminopyridine N-oxides (NAPNO), the above-mentioned properties are expected. Five X-ray structures together with their spectral properties have been studied to date. Mostly, they occur as the centrosymmetric dimers although in the case of meta-substitution by the nitramino group (NA) with respect to the NO group, acentric crystals are formed. This work is a continuation of the above issue and its primary purpose was to investigate the crystal and the molecular structure of 6-methyl-2-nitraminopyridine N-oxide (6M). In the second place, effect of dimerization was analyzed by means of semiempirical (PM3) calculations and both findings were compared to other N-oxides of NAPNO series.

The first involves producing a template of the CA rule, in a method specific to each type of domain, from which a rule sample can be generated. For cyclic domains with rule radius greater than two, an extra criterion of domain growth is needed. The second stage calculates the domain area and the ratio of thin domain area to whole domain area from the space-time diagrams in order to exclude inappropriate rules.

It is concluded that the mean square error (MSE) of plane point position is ±0.023 m and the MSE of elevation is ±0.015 m. On the premise that the accuracy meets the requirements of Quality Inspection and Acceptance of Surveying and Mapping Results (GB/T24356-2009) and the Code for Engineering Survey (GB50026-2020). Then draw building elevation. The MSE of the measured distance difference between the length of the characteristic part on the building elevation drawn by point cloud data and the corresponding part of the North Gate of Yunlong Mountain is ±6.0 mm. This paper analyses the main sources of error. Applies the elevation of the North Gate of Yunlong Mountain drawn by point cloud data in protection of historic buildings, which can meet the needs of practical engineering, so the application prospect of 3-D laser scanning is considerable in protection and repair of historic buildings.",

The coils welded range from 0.15 to 0.30 mm in thickness and from 800 to 1100 mm in width. Because the strip is very thin compared to its width, the laser line welding is likely to cause defects such as pinholes on the weld bead. Depending on the diameter of pinholes, the hole-shaped defects on the seam can significantly reduce weld quality including tensile strength and bending strength. To prevent generation of such defects, a hydraulic control device is integrated into the laser line welder so that the positions for cutting and welding by laser are placed with ±30 μm of the target; furthermore, to avoid weld failure, a vision system has been optimized for real-time inspection of the weld zone and detection of weld defects both before and after welding.",

    "abstract": "The hypercomputation debate consists of deciding upon the possibility of constructing a hypercomputing device. Amongst potential building strategies, strategy O – where O stands for oracle – refers to the construction of a device that could hypercompute with the aid of a physical oracle, namely external information coming from nature. Although a number of oracular devices have been devised, they are not generally considered as viable proposals, especially given they supposedly involve conceptual and physical issues. This article is intended to defend strategy O though. It will be argued that strategy O is unfairly criticised, for criticisms are largely the result of misunderstandings about what physical oracles are and what they are capable of. This will allow the concept of an oracle to be better understood, so that the hypercomputation debate can make progress.",

Furthermore, we report ultrafast pump & probe measurements of hybrid 1-D photonic bandgap structures consisting of an inorganic microcavity with an organic Kerr material. By varying the pump beam wavelength across the cavity resonance, we are able to distinguish between the underlying nonlinear absorption and the dispersion necessary for all-optical switching.

Hence there is the reduction of (M-1) multiplication operations which results in reduction of power consumption and enhancement in speed of operation. It produces a power reduction of great deal more than 50% and comparatively much lower processing delay. In this algorithm improvements in FFT block in the conventional design is also proposed.

It was shown that laser surface alloying produced a relatively smooth, crack-free and hard surface layer. The interface between the alloyed layer and the substrate showed a good metallurgical joint. The hardness of the surface layer was increased significantly over the base ZM5 Mg alloy due to the formation of dispersive hard particles of SiC and the effect of refinement of the alloyed microstructure.",

The use of this current level control technique enables the minimization of power dissipation while maintaining the operating frequency. The proposed circuit is applied to a pipelined MVCM multiplier, and its effectiveness is confirmed by carrying out an HSPICE simulation in 0.13um CMOS technology. In addition, the relationship between the current-level control granularity and the rate of performance improvement is confirmed. As compared to a conventional MVCM implementation, the MVCM multiplier with an 8-level current-control scheme achieves a power reduction of 65.1% at an operating frequency of 100 MHz and 26.5% at 500 MHz with an area overhead of 6.88%.",

Cellular automaton is used as the reservoir of dynamical systems. Input is randomly projected onto the initial conditions of automaton cells and nonlinear computation is performed on the input via application of a rule in the automaton for a period of time. The evolution of the automaton creates a space-time volume of the automaton state space, and it is used as the feature vector. The proposed framework requires orders of magnitude less computation compared to Echo State Networks. We prove that cellular automaton reservoir holds a distributed representation of attribute statistics, which provides a more effective computation than local representation. It is possible to estimate the kernel for linear cellular automata via metric learning, that enables a much more efficient distance computation in support vector machines framework.",

This paper attempts to apply terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to measure lateral deformations of a soil mixing retaining wall at an ongoing excavation site. Reference measurements by total station and inclinometer were also conducted to verify those from the laser scanning. The deformations derived using laser scanning data were consistent with the reference measurements at the top part of the retaining wall (mainly the ring beam of the wall). This research also shows that the multi-scale-model-to-model method was the most accurate deformation estimation method on the research data.",

To improvise the efficiency and reliability of the energy conversion systems, thermally sprayed wear resistant hard coatings have been investigated lately. In this research, WC-10Co-4Cr coating was deposited on textured and non-textured 420 martensitic stainless steel using high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) coating process. Laser surface texturing (LST) was performed to improve the deterministic surface hardness and thus mechanical interlocking at the coating-substrate interface. The WC-10Co-4Cr coating’s Vickers hardness showed an increase in microhardness compared to the sand blasting pre-treatment. The modified Williamson Hall (W-H) plot method has been employed to estimate selected lattice parameters using X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the pristine 420 stainless steel substrate, the laser surface textured 420 stainless steel and the WC-10Co-4Cr coated and laser surface textured surfaces. Results indicate that the lattice strain in the textured surface was found to be highest among other surfaces due to the microstructural modifications primarily due to the surface dislocations resulting from the laser ablation. Whereas, the WC-10Co-4Cr coated surface had less strain ascribed to the regularly ordered roughness of the laser patterning before coating; moreover, LST resulted in an effective increase in the surface hardness of the coated specimens.",

In the present study, laser short-pulse heating of a three layer assembly, consisting of Au-Cr-Cu, is examined. The electron and lattice site temperature rise in each layer is predicted using an electron lattice theory approach. Three-dimensional heating situation is accommodated in the model study. The Seebeck coefficient in each layer is computed and compared with the results of the previously derived equation. It is found that the electron temperature distribution varies in each layer and that this variation affects the lattice site temperature distribution. The lattice temperature distribution in the radial direction is not influenced by the diffusion of energy in the radial direction.

The experimental results showed that the local microscale deformation is induced in the margin of the spot due to the plastic flow of the material. During the massive LSP process the local microscale deformation has a significant influence on the surface quality. The secondary plastic flow of local microscale deformation in the margin repeatedly regulated the surface profile. The average surface roughness during massive LSP treatment initially increased as the overlapping rate increased from 0 to 33%, and then decreased as the overlapping rate rose to 50%. The peak-to-valley surface roughness decreased with the increasing overlapping rate. It personifies that the evolution of surface profile and residual stress are significantly affected by the repeated plastic flow.",

A fuzzy rule-based system for risk estimation of cardiovascular patients is proposed. It uses a group of fuzzy rules as a knowledge representation about data pertaining to cardiovascular patients. Several algorithms for the discovery of an easily readable and understandable group of fuzzy rules are formalized and analysed. The accuracy of risk estimation and the interpretability of fuzzy rules are discussed. Our study shows, in comparison to other algorithms used in knowledge discovery, that classification with a group of fuzzy rules is a useful technique for risk estimation of cardiovascular patients.",

    "abstract": "Most of the manufacturing processes introduce a locked-in stress state in the material that can have strong effect on the lifetime of the component. The presence of residual stress must be conveniently taken into account during the design process and minimized when possible. Thermal processing of the component is also possible in order to relax residual stress. If a proper thermal cycle is designed for the specific material it can be possible to reduce and even eliminate the state of stress. In this paper we explored an alternative approach to obtain stress relaxation based upon the focusing on the surface of an Al 5068 aluminium alloy of a high power diode laser (HPDL) source. In this way it is possible to obtain a localized effect of stress relaxation limited to the neighbourhood of the area irradiated by the laser beam. Final results, however, depend upon several factors, such as the adopted wavelength, the reflectivity of the material at that specific wavelength, the power of the HPDL source, the mode distribution and the duration of the irradiation. In this work temperature field distributions are calculated for the case of interaction with a point source, a Gaussian source and a double-Gaussian source. For these two, in particular, the influence of the HPDL power was studied. Results obtained by the double-Gaussian distribution analysis were used to set the proper experimental parameter for the experimental study. Finally, repeated annealing cycles were performed and the sample and the obtained stress reduction was evaluated by X-Ray diffraction.",

Characterization of PSLC assembly refers to the evaluation of electro-optical features, but also to the influence of polymeric network on these properties. This influence has been studied, by using such experimental techniques as polarizing electron microscopy, or DSC. At the same time, the investigation of the polymerization process evolution by using IR dichroism experiments offers information regarding the induced ordering in the polymer domain. The possibility for obtaining a rich variety of morphologies, using non-mesogenic monomers, (each showing a unique electro-optical response) has been demonstrated.",

These ranking techniques are well applied on pentagonal fully fuzzy transportation problem and triangular fuzzy transportation problem (FTP) of type II.

Given that task scheduling is in general a NP-hard problem, we rely on an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to provide an optimal solution in an acceptable amount of time. If the EA is not capable to provide a viable solution, in the sense that not all task deadlines are met, we resort to a modified version of the well known YDS algorithm. In this way, the methodology we propose always provides a viable solution to the scheduling problem. In the tested scenarios, our EA can save up to 55 − 90% more energy on average than our modified YDS algorithm. We also model task dependence using copula theory in the EA and prove that better results can be obtained when the dependence is modeled. The resulting stochastic scheduler can save up to 18% more energy on average compared to the deterministic scheduler.",

    "abstract": "Facility location is one of the most important long-term strategic decisions made by any organization. The importance comes from the fact that this decision is given once and it is almost impossible to change later. In this study facility location problem is solved by both subjective and objective methods. Analytical Hierarchy Process, as a subjective method, is used to decrease the number of alternative facility locations in the first phase. In the second phase, a mathematical model is developed as an objective model. This model should consider both the demand of the customers and the distance and/or travel time between the customers and the company. In practice, travel times and demand are not constant since they are affected by many factors. Therefore, one should take into account uncertainty while solving the problem. This study formulates the problem by considering the demand as fuzzy and travel time as varying based on different time intervals, which are defined hourly, daily and seasonally. Thus, all possible conditions of traffic and demand variability are taken into account. Moreover, we consider the cases of minimum speed, average speed and maximum speed for travel time in order to make a sensitivity analysis. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework using data of a company in Istanbul. We compare the proposed framework with the traditional distance based optimization approach and show the advantages of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The signal returns from radar targets are usually buried in thermal noise and clutter. Target detection is commonly performed by comparing radar returns to an adaptive threshold such that a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) is maintained. The threshold in a CFAR detector is set on a cell by cell basis according to the estimated noise/clutter power, which is determined by processing a group of reference cells surrounding the cell under investigation. In this paper, a configurable Field Programmable GateArray (FPGA)-based hardware architecture forTrimmed Mean (TM)-CFAR processor for radar target detection is presented. The proposed processor is designed, implemented, and tested using Stratix FPGA chip (EP2S60F1020C4 device). The system has the advantages of being simple, fast, and flexible with low development cost. For a reference window of length 16 cells, the experimental results carried out using Altera development kit showed that the proposed processor works properly with a processing speed up to 100 MHz.",

Comparing with traditional single-lap welding test method, which needs two sheets lap and single welding seam, the improved double-lap welding test method is characterized by four symmetrical sheets lap with four welding seams. Transparent polypropylene and opaque polypropylene were joined together by two inter-comparable methods, single-lap joint and double-lap joint, respectively. The tensile-shearing strength of the resultant samples was examined respectively. The results show that, no deflection distortions are observed in the welding seam of double-lap specimens due to the absence of additional bending moments. And the contrast single-lap joint specimens display a certain deflection distortion angle, which is caused by additional bending moments in the tensile-shearing test process. The resultant testing values of shearing strength of double-lap joint specimens are generally higher than single-lap joint samples even at the same energy density level, due to the replacement of un-synchronous fracture of single-lap joint seam by synchronous fracture of double-lap joint seam.",

We prove that any internal state (state-morphism) on a pseudo-equality algebra is also an internal state (state-morphism) on its corresponding pseudo-BCK(pC) meet-semilattice, and we prove the converse for the case of linearly ordered symmetric pseudo-equality algebras. We also show that any internal state (state-morphism) on a pseudo-BCK(pC) meet-semilattice is also an internal state (state-morphism) on its corresponding pseudoequality algebra. The notion of a Bosbach state on a pointed pseudoequality algebra is introduced and it is proved that any Bosbach state on a pointed pseudo-equality algebra is also a Bosbach state on its corresponding pointed pseudo-BCK(pC) meet-semilattice. For the case of an invariant pointed pseudo-equality algebra, we show that the Bosbach states on the two structures coincide.",

This study is motivated by investigations on protein crystal growth for which it is known that shear flow in the protein solution affects the nucleation rate. It is of interest to be able to generate and control shear flow in the sessile-drop geometry which is commonly used for crystal growth and aggregation. While drops for such experiments are usually of the spherical-cap shape, the enormous analytical complexity has led us to deal with a two-dimensional case first, i.e., the cylindrical equivalent of the cap. With the bipolar coordinate system, the circular interface can be exactly identified by constant value of one of the coordinates, and lends itself to satisfying the relevant continuity conditions at the gas-liquid and the solid-liquid interfaces of the system. The analysis yields an exact solution in the creeping-flow regime in the form of a Fourier integral. The numerical evaluation of the integral provides the flow streamlines along with the shear stress distribution within the drop. It is expected that these results will be useful in controlling and qualifying the shear rate in the drop.",

However, although this equation adequately describes the diffusion of a solute liquid in such systems, it cannot describe the different motions of the differently charged solute ions. Therefore, this study employs a particle model to simulate solute ionic migration. Using the Navier-Stokes equation and the PIC (Particle in Cell) method, this study examines the absolute mobility of negatively and positively charged ions in non-aqueous solvents in cross-type and double T-type form CZE system. The reduction in the electroosmotic velocity caused by the geometry change as the injected flow exits the injection channel and enters the separation section region of the microchannel is quantified using a geometry factor, α, defined as the ratio of the electroosmotic velocity in the cross region of the microchannel to that in the injection channel. Furthermore, the study introduces an ionic migration factor, γ, to relate the electroosmotic velocity and electrophoresis velocity of the charged ions. Simulations are performed at various values of the ionic migration factor and Reynolds number to determine the operating conditions which ensure that both the negatively charged ions and the positively charged ions can migrate into the separation section of the microchannel for subsequent detection in the downstream region of the separation channel. The numerical approach proposed in this study enables suitable operating conditions for cross-type and double T-type form CZE systems to be established without the need for an experimental trial-and-error approach.",

One critical step in processing of terrestrial laser scanner measurements is the registration of point clouds into a common coordinate system. Thus, it is an important research topic for geosciences community. The iterative closest point (ICP) is mostly preferred to registration of point clouds in 3-D modelling studies. It performs the registration iteratively by the closest corresponding points. In this study, the effect of point density on registration accuracy of point clouds by the ICP was investigated. For this purpose, the laser scans were conducted with different point density, and the registration was executed by the ICP. Then the accuracies of the registrations were compared by the residuals of the check point coordinates. This study shows that the low point density slightly reduces the registration accuracy of the ICP. Nevertheless, since the registration parameters are computed using the high number of points, the ICP satisfies the expected accuracy for the work.",

We present here such a system which detects the anomalies in honeycomb structures. ALabVIEW based software has been developed to control the precision movement of the piezoelectric transducer unit for phase shifting, storing, and for real-time visualization of deviations of the correlation speckle and speckle shear patterns near the defect area. A (5,1) phase shifting algorithm is used for quantitative analysis. Such an algorithm is suitable for NDE of structures under quasi-dynamic loads. An advanced filtering technique has been incorporated to reduce the speckle noise and improve the wrapped or modulo-2&Mac185; phase map obtained from the phase shifted speckle and speckle shear fringe patterns.

In the proposed application, a modular shading system for building facade is driven by a two color, one dimensional, range 2 CA rule {3818817080,2,2}. The SIC optimization criteria are: visual attractiveness, gradual and intuitive transition from one density level to another and even distribution of the pattern over the entire array. The ideal solutions for 10 square arrays of 7×7, 8×8,…, 16×16 cells are found by an exhaustive search method – the backtracking. The encoding of SICs using the order-based representation is introduced. A cost function evaluating both monotonicity of the average density transition, and the distribution of shading pattern is introduced. For a 100×100 cell array EA is implemented with three setups: without crossover but with intensive mutation, with crossover and without mutation, and with both crossover and mutation. Two types of crossover operations are used: uniform (UX) and onepoint (OPX). A number of experiments with various combinations of parameters were performed. The results are compared and the recommended strategy is briefly discussed. The best result was produced by EA with OPX and mutation rate 0.4.",

We model this underlying substratum as a structurally dynamic cellular network (basically a generalisation of a cellular automaton).We regard these continuum concepts and continuum spacetime in particular as being emergent, coarse-grained and derived relative to this underlying erratic and disordered microscopic substratum, which we would like to call quantum geometry and which is expected to play by quite different rules, namely generalized cellular automaton rules. A central role in our analysis is played by a geometric renormalization group which creates (among other things) a kind of sparse translocal network of correlations between the points in classical continuous space-time and underlies, in our view, such mysterious phenomena as holography and the black hole entropy-area law. The same point of view holds for quantum theory which we also regard as a low-energy, coarse grained continuum theory, being emergent from something more fundamental. In this paper we review our approach and compare it to the quantum graphity framework.",

The heat transfer coefficient given by the SBM is found to be close to the steady heat transfer coefficient determined under the constant wall temperature (CWT) as a boundary condition. It is also found that the rate of heat transfer enhancement for the CWT boundary condition can be determined by the SBM with an accuracy of better than 5% for the present conditions.",

A 10 J Nd:YAG laser was used for the LSP operation. Following LSP detailed microstructural and phase analysis along with residual stress and hardness studies were undertaken. A parametric window was first established to explore the relationship between LSP process parameters and the respective surface and bulk properties. The effects of an absorptive layer on the properties of the modified layer were also investigated. Qualitative and quantitative information on dislocation density was obtained using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and correlated with the processing parameters. Residual stress developed following LSP was measured using the XRD technique. An increase in the hardness of the Ni-based superalloys was observed. The residual stress on the surface of the laser shock peened Hastelloy-X superalloy showed a maximum compressive stress of 166 MPa. A detailed microstructure-property relationship was established to understand the mechanism of property enhancement. Further optimization of the LSP process to surface treat the Hastelloy-X superalloys will open up new avenues for the material’s applicability, particularly in the aerospace sector.",

Hence in this paper, A Deep Learning Video Surveillance (DLVS) Technique for Automatic Data Collection and Processing of Sport Activity Prediction is proposed to improve the efficient factors by minimizing the time and data storage consumption. The significant activity prediction of sports frames is being achieved in an optimized manner. The detailed data and feature extraction in a moving sports video are optimized by introducing the Optimal Moving Frame Analysis Algorithm (OMFAA). Likewise, a data collection and processing protocol (DSPP) is presented to ensure effective pixel processing and classification of video frames in sports activity prediction, which is considered a significant factor in DLVS-ADCP. The simulation research is performed with an available sports video database, and it is validated based on the parameters like accuracy, performance, optimization factor, and reliability.",

A short laser pulse of 300 μs was applied to heat the bottom surface of a disk shaped specimen, resulting in a time-dependent temperature increase at the top surface. Corrections for the laser pulse length as well as heat loss due to surface radiation and heat conduction were applied in order to evaluate the half time value by fitting a transient heat conduction model to the measured values of the temperature increase. Thermal diffusivity was calculated from specimen thickness, corrected for thermal expansion of the specimen, and the half time value. A sapphire crucible was used to contain the specimen in the mushy region and in the liquid state. As the laser is firing from below at the bottom surface of the specimen, the thickness of the melt has to be slight to avoid significant buoyancy.

The analysis reveals possible tensions these dialogic interactions can create and informs our understanding of how online educators are also positioned as learners', ' endeavoring to understand the repercussions of their online interactions and teaching practices. This paper adds to this emerging literature employing the concept of obuchenie by examining how particular affordances and constraints of teaching and learning unfold in an authentic online learning context.']",

Two AE schemes, Tiny- Jambu and Elephant, are finalists of NIST lightweight cryptography competition. Another AE scheme, ACORN v3, a CAESAR competition finalist, has been shown to be particularly vulnerable against Differential Fault Attack (DFA), even more than its previous version ACORN v2. TinyJambu is also susceptible to DFA. An optimized interpolation attack has been proposed against one instance of Elephant, Delirium, recently. We propose methods to strengthen these schemes using the Cellular Automata (CA) and increase their resistance to these attacks. The Programmable Cellular Automata (PCA) 90-150 is effectively deployed to make these ciphers robust against DFA. We also provide mathematical analysis of the invigorated schemes and show that significant improvement is achieved in all the three enhanced schemes.",

The peak of the autocorrelation is always located at zero. Peak position of the cross-correlation, which generally deviates from zero, corresponds to the speckle displacement, whereas the decrease in peak height is associated with change in structure, so-called decorrelation.",

The expected total cost that includes fuzzy parameters is minimized by marginal analysis and defuzzified by the centroid defuzzification method.

The speed of translating the genotype (encoded binary strings) to the phenotype (circuits) depends on how fast is the creation of the circuit functional representation and how fast this representation can be evaluated to determine its function. We present the comparison between an efficient representation of the synthesized quantum circuit as Quantum Multi-Valued Decision Diagram (QMDD) and a low level parallelized evaluation method using hardware accelerated matrix manipulation. We compare the circuit representation’s computation speed as well as the used computational resources on various steps of the overall design of the circuit. As it is shown in the experiments, each approach has its advantages and limitations, and an appropriate choice of each of them yields better results for a subset of the Quantum Logic synthesis (QLS) problems.",

The CALPHAD (calculation of phase diagrams) method has been identified as one of the pillars of ICME. The CALPHAD method, originally developed to model thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams, uses extrapolation methods for the functions of binary and ternary systems that enable the calculation of the properties of higher-order systems. The CALPHAD functions are built to a large extent on available experimental data for these binary and ternary systems. To ensure reliability of the results from CALPHAD calculations, it is necessary to critically evaluate the experimental data that are being used for developing the CALPHAD functions. This review presents a brief overview of the CALPHAD method and its models, summarizes the data that are needed and the criteria that need to be applied for the evaluation of these data.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of plasma and detonation wave characteristics induced by laser ablating target is very important to recognizing the mechanism of laser driven flyer and laser destruction. In this study a laser ablating aluminium target experiment has been carried out, employing Schlieren photography technique for visualizing detonation wave temporal evolution and to analyse detonation wave attenuation law. A numerical model of detonation wave evolution induced by laser ablation has been established: phase transformation volume fraction is employed to describe target vaporization; plasma state equation is obtained by calculating vapour ionization degree; interaction of laser and plasma is considered. Numerical simulation of laser ablating aluminium target has been conducted, analysing the unsteady ablation process of target. Comparison of shockwave propagation speed and compressed air thickness between calculated results and experimental data validates the calculation method. Results show that shockwave evolution has a complicated structure with multi-density discontinuities. During detonation wave evolution, wave front transforms from half elliptical in early stage into half spherical and peak density location changes from wave front to interior. The fluctuating range of target ablation rate under laser action (672 mJ, duration is 24 ns) is 0.08 to 0.32 mm/ns. Plasma density distribution is related to laser energy variation. After laser pulse, ionization degree and electron number density of plasma first decreases slowly and then dropped dramatically.",

Tests were done to characterize the skin/foam interface and to determine the hydraulic and thermal characteristics of the heat exchangers and correlations developed to calculate Fanning friction factor and Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number for airflow through the sandwich structure.

    "abstract": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is a nonlinear process which involves melting of powder metal using laser to manufacture intricate metallic parts. During laser melting, the meltpool dynamics are influenced by initial laser processing parameters such as laser power and scan speed. Understanding of the meltpool flow physics and associated heat transfer is important for producing stable meltpool and hence high quality layers and parts. This research work focuses on the steady state numerical simulation of heat flux driven flows in the meltpool of pure metal (24 carat gold powder). Experimental observations indicated a relationship between the sizes of balling and the laser energy density, while no such relationship could be deduced for the change in the spatial gap between the droplets or balling. The splitting of meltpool away from the path of scan and first line balling was also observed. Simulation results predict the formation of different types of balling at different scan speeds and heat flux to be linked with heat transfer from the meltpool. Results indicate that the size of meltpool is largely dependent on the applied heat flux and its rate of transport to the surroundings i.e. boundary conditions. The steady state velocity patterns in the meltpool, driven by heat flux from the neighbouring surfaces, match well with experimental results.",

The best strategy reached performance of 94 − 99% with a modulo 6 limitation for the number of cells.

Because of the ways these structures can influence human behavior, they have significant impact on virtually all forms of human activity. This is particularly so in the areas of instruction, learning, and expert performance. Because of the important role mental models play in these areas, this paper investigates their significance in learning a complex cognitive task in the context of troubleshooting and maintaining a complex simulated system. The focus of this investigation is on the learning-dependent progression of mental models as learners master the performance of a complex task. Accordingly, the learners´ mental models were assessed at different points of accomplishing a complex troubleshooting skill within the realm of a simulation program. 26 engineering and chemical engineering students were recruited from engineering classes at Florida State University (14 male and 12 female). These subjects were randomly assigned to two experimental treatments (timed and self-paced). The measures of mental model progression during the second and third phase of the treatment showed that the subjects were faced with an uncertain situation which fragmented their under-standing of the task. In terms of the development and progression of mental model, students ended up with the same mental model as their first one prior to receiving the treatment. The results are discussed with regard to mental model theory and instructional implications.",

The experiments were performed on samples of thin AMS 5510 stainless steel 321 sheet with thickness of 0.01 inch by a 500.00 W fibre laser. The results indicated that the entrance hole diameter and hole taper decrease when the laser pulse frequency increases and laser power decreases. Also, laser frequency has a double reaction before duty cycle and laser powers on circularity of entrance hole. Minimum hole taper, minimum entrance diameter, and maximum circularity of entrance hole were considered as optimization criteria.

Next, by means of a planar target with a cruciform pattern, multiple sets of three-dimensional (3-D) feature points are solved in the camera coordinate system. Last, a new method is proposed for solving the structured light planes in which a uniform objective function is determined and the priori position relation of the structured light planes is considered as a constraint. In this way the prior geometric relation of the planes can be accurately transplanted into the camera coordinate system. Experimental data demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits better accuracy and repeatability.",

Since Log domain filters are attractive in respect of circuit architecture, dynamic range at low supply voltage, high frequency operation, IC implementation and electronic tunability. By this approach, active RC- filter structures can be transformed into Log-domain with linear transfer characteristics. The proposed technique can be applied to any active RC filter. RC-active filter using CCII is taken as a prototype filter as an example to demonstrate the approach. Advantages of the proposed filter include high frequency operation, electronic tunability, low supply voltage operation, low power consumption. PSPICE simulation results are included which are in close conformity with the theoretical results.",

Laser scanners collect spatial point data from the scan area in a short time, and laser scanning data have their own local co-ordinates in each station. The other hand, 3-D modelling applications require many scans from different stations to obtain occlusion free 3-D model. In such a case, all scans must be registered into a common reference co-ordinate system. Registration of point cloud into the reference co-ordinate system is still an important research topic in photogrammetry and computer sciences fields. Many methods have been developed for registration of point clouds. Nevertheless, if there is no implicit entity on the scan area, these methods are not practicable because corresponding points can not be selected from the point clouds. In this study point clouds were registered by the image recorded by the sensor combination camera. Although many laser scanners have integrated camera, a high resolution digital camera is usually mounted to the laser scanner for efficient 3-D modelling. The image based registrations with the sensor combination of laser scanner and camera were performed by making use of a single image, relative orientation and bundle adjustment triangulation methods. The results were compared with the iterative closest point (ICP) which is the most widely used method for registration of point clouds.",

For instance, existing theories usually do not permit the decision-makers to consider bipolarity of parameters in a system. This study initiates the theory of a new hybrid model for group decision-making, namely, bipolar soft expert sets as a natural extension of two existing models (that is, soft expert sets and bipolar soft sets) because presented model is very suitable to describe the bipolarity of soft information with the opinions of more than one experts. Some fundamental properties of the developed hybrid model are discussed, namely, subset, complement, agree-BSES, disagree-BSES, union, intersection, AND operation and OR operation. Our proposed concepts are explained with illustrative examples. Further, to demonstrate the applicability of our initiated model, two applications of our proposed hybrid model are explored along with developed algorithms to tackle different group decision-making situations, that is, selection of a suitable automobile and an appropriate restaurant. Finally, a comparison analysis of the proposed model with existing models, including bipolar soft sets and soft experts sets is provided to show the supremacy of our initiated model.",

Thus, even small defects in the particles, which break the ideal symmetry and can attract strong local fields, can lead to significant second-harmonic signals forbidden by the ideal symmetry. Designing nonlinear metamaterials with desired properties is not possible if the fabrication defects significantly affect the optical response of the structure. We show that recent improvements in sample quality allow the selection rules for second-harmonic generation to be much better fulfilled than ever before. We are thus approaching the limit where such structures can be used to design nonlinear metamaterials for future applications.",

The weld macrostructures were seen to be free from cracks and defects, exhibiting complete penetration and the crest (top width) of the weld increases with the thermal energy supplied. In the microanalysis, growth of dendrite grains from periphery to mid-section of the weld was observed. In addition, Mo rich compounds and carbides are witnessed in the weld zone (WZ) for higher thermal energy conditions.

The core process of fracture splitting is the pre-processing of a fracture splitting notch. This paper investigates how Nd:YAG laser processing can be used to generate a fracture splitting notch in a C70S6 steel connecting rod, looking at the working conditions of the laser grooving, developing a finite element analysis (FEA) model and then performing a numerical simulation of the temperature field generated during the laser grooving. In the evaluation of the numerical model the effects of varying parameters such as laser pulse power, spot size, traverse speed and pulse width on the different outcomes of the temperature field were compared. The change law with regard to the variation of depth and width on the fracture splitting notch was derived and the different manufacturing parameters that affect the formation, shape and the root radius of the notch were studied and discussed. The results indicated that: (i) The notch depth increased as the laser pulse power increased and the pulse width increased, and decreased as the spot size increased and the traverse speed increased; (ii) The notch width increased as both the spot size and the pulse width increased; (iii) The impact of the laser pulse power and traverse speed on the notch width was only minimal; (iv) An appropriate match between a long pulse width and the traverse speed was the key to obtaining a sharp fracture splitting notch; (v) A pocket- like hole was likely to form when the traverse speed was low and this hole would not be continuous when the speed was high; (vi) The notch root would not be sharp enough when the pulse width was short and some slag was likely to form near to the fracture splitting notch when the pulse width was long. Ultimately a set of optimal parameters were established.",

We propose dual-wavelength digital image-plane holographic microscopy (DDIPHM) to suppress the phase noise in the measurement. Differently from the dual-wavelength unwrapping algorithm, DDIPHM cuts down a noise source by avoiding diffraction calculation so that the calculation error need not to be considered and the noise is decreased. The experimental results concerning a micro-step proved that the DDIPHM is an excellent method in processing noises especially in the measuring environment with relatively high noise level. The noise level in DDIPHM is about one third of that in DDHM.",

    "abstract": "Preference relation is a usual preference elicitation structure in decision making problems, because of its simplicity and clarity for experts involved. However different issues related to preference elicitation make necessary to check that such relations have at least a minimal consistency to obtain meaningful decisions. Consistency of preference relations is related to rationality of experts’ preferences and it ensures that their elicitation does not follow either a random or an illogical process. The lack of consistency leads to useless and wrong decisions. Hence the consistency checking of preference relations is a crucial and challenging issue across the decision process. Consequently multiple proposals have been introduced to study the consistency of preference relations. Keeping in mind the importance of consistency and taking into account the recent and high interest of hesitant fuzzy information in decision making with appearance of Hesitant Fuzzy Sets, this paper aims at establishing a clear taxonomy regarding the types of consistency of preference relations with hesitant information such as, hesitant fuzzy preference relation, hesitant multiplicative preference relation, and the extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation; pointing out those cases that make no sense to study, and proposing new definitions for the types of consistency when dealing with hesitant preference relations in those cases that either there have not been defined yet or in those ones in which current definitions can be improved.",

The associated process parameters are grouped into two representing quantities: laser intensity and effective energy. The study demonstrates the effect of these two quantities on the surface topography (shape, periodicity, and roughness), heat affected zone (HAZ), chemical composition (oxidation and titanium phase transformation) and mechanical properties (hardness) of the modified surface. It is shown that the microstructures initiation is not possible until laser intensity reaches a certain value close to the damage threshold of the material. After the microstructures are initiated, the laser intensity may remain constant and the growth of structures is mainly controlled by the effective energy.",

Mental models are usually represented by either short text summary or a graphical map (i.e., concept map). This study aimed attesting which learner’s mental representation associates higher with three criteria: original text, expert concept map, and expert text summary. HIMATT, a mathematical framework proven to share a sound reliability of mental model in both semantic and graphical formats, was used to elicit the association between students’ mental models and the three criteria reference models following studying two book chapters. The findings indicate that across all association indices, students’ text summary elicitations were stronger than the students’ concept map elicitations over the three criterion-reference models. Moreover, stronger similarities emerged for the four structure indices (surface, graphic, structure, and gamma) than for the three semantic indices (concept, proposition, and balance) within the text summary and concept map formats. The results are attributed to students’ strong familiarity with written representation of the learning materials rather than creating concept maps. Furthermore, the results indicate that reading a text stored in long-term memory and retrieving and representing it into a concept map is harder than retrieving and representing it in a written text. Further research must clarify to what extent the practice of transforming written materials into graphical maps will improve the validity of using concept maps for mental conceptualization.",

    "abstract": "Powder blown laser cladding is widely applied in industry to achieve functional surface modifications for corrosion or wear resistance. Commonly this is deposited in the 1G flat position in accordance to the ASME BPVC Section IX (equivalent to the ISO 6947 PA position). For certain applications, however, especially large and heavy components which are difficult to manipulate, the cladding of vertical surfaces would be beneficial – cladding in 2G horizontal position in accordance to the ASMCE BPVC Section IX (equivalently to the ISO 6947 PC position). The task of cladding vertical surfaces requires a specially designed cladding head. The aim of this report is to present those initial results observed through depositing powder in this attitude using a high power diode laser (HPDL). It was observed that the change of the position of the cladded surface from flat to horizontal or vertical affects the cladding process. The reason for this is that gravity affects the powder stream and weld pool in a different way. An optimized parameter set for the 1G (PA) cladding resulted in inferior clads with extensive dilution leading to inhomogeneous properties within the clad; therefore a specific cladding parameter set for the 2G (PC) position had to be developed. Different laser beam sizes and cladding parameters were investigated with the aim of achieving well bonded, crack-free overlapping beads with minimal dilution. The results indicate that the amount of transport gas and the position of a laser head critically influence the clad quality and that generally a smaller laser spot gives better results.",

Biotherapeutics including enzymes and genetic materials require specific sub-cellular addressing not attainable naturally. Endothelium, lining the luminal surface of blood vessels, represents a key therapeutic target in many diseases. Studies in cell culture and animal models revealed that targeted delivery of therapeutics to, into and across endothelium can be achieved using carriers targeted to specific molecules expressed on the surface of the endothelial cells. For example, cell adhesion molecules represent attractive targets for drug delivery. Rational design of the drug delivery systems (e.g., selection of optimal geometry and affinity to specific epitopes) provides an unprecedented level of control of such parameters of drug delivery as pharmacokinetics, circulation in blood, binding to selected endothelial cell phenotypes, anchoring on cell surface or internalization into the endothelium, subsequent intracellular addressing and duration of the effects. We discusse here key aspects of design of endothelium-targeted drug delivery systems with potential for translation into the clinical domain.",

To determine the fuzzy membership function, the normalized weekly cumulative rate of returns of prediction models were utilized as the criteria. In addition to proposing a new approach, our research varies from previous studies in terms of data coverage and the models that we used in both sentiment analysis and prediction phase. Performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated with the cases where news and financial data are used separately and together. Feature selection methods were also integrated before the prediction phase. The final results show that the proposed methodology outperforms both in terms of rate of return and accuracy.",

In this case, collisional processes (between the sub-systems), govern the energy transport. Moreover, due to a large electron temperature difference within the substrate material, electrons flow from a high temperature region to a low temperature region, which results in a Seebeck current. In this case, electrons work against the potential charge. In the present study, the temperature field in the gold-copper two layer assembly is computed using the electron kinetic theory approach. The Seebeck coefficient is derived and determined in the assembly. The volumetric rate of entropy generation in the electron and lattice sub-systems due to the temperature field and the Seebeck effect is predicted. It is found that a noticeable change in the Seebeck coefficient occurs across the layers despite the smooth changes in the electron temperature. The rate of the volumetric entropy generation is high just below the surface whereas the entropy generation rate decreases with increasing depth from the surface in the lattice sub-system.",

A scanning electron microscope and optical profiler are utilised to analyse the treated surfaces, revealing deep valleys from laser treatment at 5 and 50 mm/s, shallow undulations from laser treatment at 500 mm/s and irregular pits from grit blasting. Best fatigue resistance is achieved with laser treatment at 500 mm/s and with grit blasting, resulting in crack growth rates two orders of magnitude below that of the degreased sample. Analysis of the resulting fracture surfaces reveals porosity in specimens subject to laser treatment at 5 and 50 mm/s, leading to marginally lower fatigue resistance than with laser exposure at 500 mm/s. With correct parameter selection, nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation is confirmed as a valid pre-treatment method for adhesive-bonded joints subject to cyclic loading, avoiding repeatability, handling and environmental issues associated with mechanical and chemical surface treatments.",

The effect of process parameters including laser power, speed and pulse width on brazing geometry (wetting angle, spreading and depth of flow) are studied using response surface methodology (RSM). Then the multi-response optimization was employed to optimize the brazing process. The optimum brazing parameters are identified in order to improve the productivity and decreasing the total operating cost. The results indicate that laser power has a direct effect on spreading and a reverse effect on wetting angle, however the effect of speed is opposite of the laser power effect. Also interaction effect of speed and laser power is significant. Decreasing pulse width results in decreasing of wetting angle and increasing of the spreading. The experimental values obtained from optimization show that the developed models are accurate with less than 6% errors.",

In digital signal processors and microprocessors, the full substractor is not only important for additions or subtracting based digital circuits like multipliers and dividers but is also used for accessing the address in memory. For low power requirements, there is a need to reduce leakage current in Full substractor to avoid the involvement of this sub device leakage and to prepare better sub circuit of any system so that the preparatory device is not get affected by these type parameters. In this paper, SVL (self-controllable voltage level) technique is introduced for leakage current reduction and then standby leakage power reduction. Using SVL technique we can provide dc voltage supply as per requirement for load circuit in active mode and decrease dc voltage supply for load circuit in standby mode. For reduction in leakage current in standby mode there are two approaches first USVL (upper self-controllable voltage level)technique in which dc voltage supply for load circuit is decreased and another one LSVL (lower self-controllable voltage level) technique in which ground voltage supply for load circuit is increased. This paper represents that leakage current of full substractor using SVL technique is reduced by 61.8% as conventional full substractor at 0.7 V dc supply. Simulation results are performed with 45nm CMOS technology, 20ns access time and 0.05GHz frequency using cadence virtuoso tool and leakage current for all cells are compared.",

This paper presents an implementation framework of kP systems and its implementation method in CUDA for solving a class of NP-hard problems. Both the framework and the method consider the implementation of the membrane structure, objects and evolution rules of kP systems. The subset sum and satisfiability problems are taken as two examples to show how an implementation that relies in CUDA environment is used for solving NP-hard problems. The implementation of the above mentioned problems shows an increase in speed of about 5% for the parallel variant compared to the normal CPU implementation.",

Generally, intermittent demand appears at random, with many time periods having no demand. Owing to peculiar characteristics of intermittent demand, demand forecasting for intermittent demand is especially difficult. There are ad hoc methods developed for intermittent demand forecasting. Since Cox process has shown superior performance for intermittent demand forecasting, we studied forecasting intermittent demand using Cox process in this study. We develop a new method for estimating Cox process intensity which is called Reversed Leven and Segerstedt (RLS) method. Moreover, we propose a novel method which is a Wavelet Transform and Reversed Leven and Segerstedt conjunction model for intermittent demand forecasting using Cox process. Using real data set of 500 kinds of spare parts from an aviation sector company in Turkey, we show that our method produces more accurate forecasts than other intermittent demand forecasting methods using Cox process. The comparison approach has a lead time perspective which is based on lead time ahead demand forecast and lead time demand forecast errors.",

The results showed that the sheet thickness significantly determine which kinds of parameters domain should be selected. The laser power is the most influential factor on the cutting region temperature and cutting edge quality; moreover, the selection of appropriate set of parameters such as power and cutting speed could be done through creation of appropriate temperature of cutting region. Changing the laser power density which results in an evident temperature variation of cutting region shows a remarkable effect on the quality of the cutting edge.",

Special attention is paid to the residual stress relaxation process of the LY2 Al-alloy sheet with different overlapping rates. Results show that residual stress relaxation is strongly dependent of overlapping rate of massive laser shock peening treatment, and the fluctuation rate decreases with increasing overlapping rate. For all overlapping rates, the most drastic relaxation exists at a depth of 0.40 mm away from the top surface. With the overlapping rate being greater than 50%, the surface residual stress exhibits a better uniformity, and a maximum of in-depth residual stress after relaxation remains unchanged for a given cyclic loading. In addition, the influence mechanism of overlapping rate on stress relaxation after the first cycle is revealed.",

    "abstract": "A new non-Darwinian-type evolutionary computation approach based on learnable evolution model is proposed for solving the shortest path problem in this article. Learnable evolution model includes a machine learning method, such as the decision trees, that can detect the right directions of the evolution and results in large improvements in the fitness of the individuals. A modified priority-based path encoding method with a repairing procedure is proposed to represent the individuals in the problem which leads to reducing the possibility of the loop formation in the path construction process. Several novel heuristics are employed in the instantiating process in order to avoid the incomplete path formation. The proposed approach is tested on networks of varying topologies and different sizes in order to verify its performance. Computer simulations justify that the proposed approach exhibits a much better quality of solution and a much higher convergence speed in comparison with other similar approaches. The proposed approach retains its robustness against changing network topologies regarding both the quality of solution and the convergence speed.",

The laser/powder interaction zone is scanned over the substrate and the molten material solidifies leaving micro-scale tracks of deposited material. The ability to deposit material on this scale opens up the possibility of a modification of the surface properties of small metallic components, the repair of fine damage such as hairline fractures and the fabrication of small components, which require high dimensional accuracy such as dental implants and maxillofacial prostheses. In this paper, the influence of various processing parameters on the laser micro-deposition of thin walls of Stellite F alloy is systematically investigated, with regard to the control of part geometry and stability of the process. The results indicated that a change of heat dissipation during deposition influences the evenness of the width of the thin wall. With reasonable processing parameters, the surface roughness (Ra) of the thin wall can be as low as 10 mm and the wall width as thin as 400 mm with a metallurgically sound structure.",

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are one of the most important factors of global warming, using fossil fuels for transportation and power generation increases GHG emissions and thus causes global warming. As a response, policymakers all over the world are empowering renewable and clean energy. In the transportation sector, the most effective way to decrease GHG emissions is to increase the utilization of electronic vehicles. As the manufacturers are moving towards the production of electronic vehicles both the quantity and the quality of the alternatives increase. Accordingly, the consumers face a new decision problem about the selection of electric vehicles. The electric vehicle selection problem is a multi-criteria decision-making problem that includes various conflicting criteria and alternatives. The criteria considered within the scope of the problem may involve the benefit type of criteria such as design, capacity, and cost type criteria such as price, acceleration. In this study, we propose Fuzzy KEmeny Median Indicator Ranks Accordance (F-KEMIRA) as an extension of the KEMIRA method. In this study, we construct a decision model involving three benefit criteria, three cost criteria, and 5 alternatives and solve it by using the proposed Fuzzy KEMIRA method.",

While Web 2.0 is well understood for things like RSS feeds, real use of Web 2.0 mash-up approaches for teaching and learning has unique challenges that must be solved before these approaches will become common and mainstream. When students are in a course, they have an identity and role in that course and these identities and roles along with course information must be communicated to these tools out on the web so the course model is maintained in the tools. For example, when using a blog for the course, the teacher should be able to “administer” the overall blog while students can post to their particular areas of the blogs.

A back-water-assisted laser processing method is proposed in this study, in which benefits can be achieved in reducing hole taper and improving hole roundness and consistency. The results show that, compared with direct laser drilling, the back-water-assisted method can reduce the taper by up to 6 , while increase the processing efficiency by 40 to 60%. The slag, recast layer of the hole walls and the deformation of the filter are also reduced significantly. In particular, this study proposes a method to assess the consistency of mass holes, and the influencing degree of each parameter on the consistency of microholes is obtained through orthogonal experiments.",

The model takes into account the absorption of the laser beam, and heating and vaporization of the target, including an adjustment to compensate for the change of state. The finite element method was employed to describe the major physical processes taking part in the laser ablation process. The stress distribution in the target material during the pulse duration is also analysed. The effect of the laser on the resulting material removal rate and residual stress distribution is investigated in detail. The calculated maximum surface temperature of the target is higher than the estimated value of copper critical temperature, corroborating the hypothesis that the ablation mechanism is explained by the explosive boiling.

However, doing so is difficult and may result in undesirable pollution with chemical cleaning. In this study as a precondition of laser welding the plate of Al-Li alloy was not treated in any way before welding. A CO2 laser system was employed in the study on porosity control of 1420 Al- Li alloy by dualbeam laser welding. The experimental results show that the influence on the right surface oxide film to the porosity in the weld is bigger than that from the backside when the laser welding is in the form of a beam on the surface of the plate. However, the sensibility of porosity from the backside oxide film has a distinct connection with the formation of an inverse weld when butt-joint laser welding is carried out. Optimized laser welding techniques have been achieved from experiments in order to decrease the porosity in the weld and increase weld quality. The tensile strength of the laser welding joint was also tested in the experiment. The data indicate that the average value of tensile strength about the joints can be up to 336.1 MPa, which is equal to 87.5% of the value of the substrate alloy.",

XRD analysis confirmed the non-crystalline nature of the prepared samples. The density and molar volume as a function of MnO concentration were determined and calculated respectively. The optical spectroscopic studies of the prepared samples were carried out over (190-2500 nm) spectral range. The glass samples has a UV cutoff wavelength and was shifted from 308 nm to 352 nm by increasing content of MnO which is very useful in the optical technology such as ultraviolet preventing applications. The optical band gap energy was decreased by increasing content of MnO. The decrease in optical band gap was proportional to the progressive increase in non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) concentration, and with the MnO increment. The refractive index was found to be enhanced with the increasing of MnO. However, the optical polarizability was found to be correlated to the chemical composition of the glass.",

One of the most important goals of the reverse logistics network design is to minimize the costs or to maximize the profit. By the way, deciding on the number of collection centers, fabrics and distribution centers in a reverse logistics system are also very important. Uncertain factors can affect a reverse logistic network negatively. In this paper to cope with these uncertainties a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model is developed for a reverse logistics network with a real case application on white goods sector refrigerator product group. In the proposed model customers’ demand, return rate of products, unit transportation cost and repair cost are considered as uncertain parameters. The proposed model is solved by using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS)/CPLEX 9.0 optimization software ant it is executed for different return and repair rates to determine and compare the number of collection centers, fabrics, distribution centers and maximum profit. The obtained results are consistent with each other.",

Study of multiple gates Omega FinFET that has a good control over body potential is an interesting and motivating structure for analyzing Gamma radiation effects concerning radiation hardened applications. By the virtue of its geometry, it should be less susceptible to the radiations as compared to single gate or double gate technologies. Omega FinFET is three dimensional in nature and therefore any meaningful process or device simulation must be performed in three dimensions. Quantum effects play major role in nano scaled devices. The impact of quantum confinement effects on the response of 25 nm Omega FinFET to Gamma irradiation is investigated using 3D quantum simulations. Results for classical and quantum transport models under low and high drain bias are compared. Gamma irradiation is performed for dose variation from 100 Krad (low injection regime) to 10 Mrad (high injection regime). Effect of irradiation on band structure, electron/hole density, total current density, mobility, fields, potential, electron temperature and generation recombination rate are computed. Disparity among quantum and classical transport results show that it is necessary to include quantum effects. As compared to single gate technologies parameters do not degrade appreciably after irradiation.",

We designed an experimental arrangement that included a modulated laser to backlight the vibrating object and to generate an analogue shadowgraph, a photodetector installed in front of the shadowgraph, is connected to a lock-in amplifier, and synchronized by the laser modulator, to retrieve the vibration signal from the noisy optical background. The method was applied successfully to detect the resonance frequency of tungsten filament at incandescence temperature inside an automotive lamp as a proof of concept. This method can be also adapted to test the thermoelastic characteristics of refractory alloy samples, the mechanical properties of high temperature refractory microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) lighting and nanostructured tungsten-based advanced thermal shock-resistant lighting sources.",

The laser surface treatment was used to produce the tensile residual stress on the surface of S355 steel specimen, which is used to simulate the residual stress produced by the welding process. The residual stresses in S355 steel specimens before and after the action of the electric current pulse were evaluated by the hole drilling method. The mechanism of residual stress relieving by the electric current pulse was discussed. The experimental results show that the high energy electric current pulse can effectively eliminate the lager tensile residual stress in S355 steel specimen. Increasing the treatment time of the electric current pulse can improve the relieving effect of residual stress. The difference between x-axial residual stress and y-axial residual stress becomes smaller by increasing the treatment time of the electric current pulse. In this case, the effect of residual stress relieving and homogenization can be improved by increasing the treatment time of the electric current pulse. The residual stress can be relieved when the sum of the external dynamic stress induced by the electric current pulse and the initial residual stress of the materials is more than the resistance for the dislocations motion. The residual stress relieving by the electric current pulse method is promising to be widely used in the industry.",

From simple to very complex three-dimensional (3-D) geometries can be manufactured to solid components from metallic, ceramic, composite or polymer powder. Methods to control the process have started to gain an essential role in laser additive manufacturing processes. The objective of this study was to investigate laser additive manufacturing monitoring methods and find suitable method for detection and calculation of thermal features. The LAM process was monitored in situ simultaneously with pyrometer and active illumination system. Energy input and volumetric energy density were compared for energy evaluation. In the study it was noticed that an increase in energy input to the range of 250 to 2000 J/m results in ball formation. Homogenous and non porous evenly distributed surface was achieved with energy input of 2500 J/m. Energy input of 5000 J/m showed interesting phenomena; layer formed is the most uniform of all results. However, some unevenly distributed porosity is noticed. It can be concluded that with energy input the heat penetration start decreasing to this semi molten surface of the stainless steel powder. At the same time, a denser surface with less balling phenomena was obtained. Collapse of surface was observed with energy input of 10000 J/m. Such behaviour with this energy input on stainless steel suggests lower heating impact what might be caused by lower absorption.",

Experimental observations indicate that the combination of laser power, joining speed and raster angle results in stronger joint quality. A quantitative analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that joint strength is influenced majorly by 46.46% contribution of laser power. Contribution of welding speed is highest for the heat affected zone (HAZ) width. Moreover, raster angle plays important factor in transferring heat at the joining area.

Relativistic nonlinearity results in increase in mass of electrons, which start oscillating at relativistic velocities in intense laser field. Relativistic nonlinearity results in self focusing of laser beam, if initial laser power exceeds the critical power. Due to self-focusing, the laser beam develop strong intensity gradient in the transverse direction in the focal region, which in turn generates the plasma wave at the pump frequency. This plasma wave further interacts with incident laser beam and a second harmonic is generated. Effect of variation in intensity of the laser beam and plasma density on the harmonic yield is studied in detail. Harmonic yield is found to increase with increase in plasma density and with decrease in laser beam intensity.",

    "abstract": "Fractional laser and radio frequency (RF) skin thermolysis technology is the technical which divide the treatment area of the patient’s skin into a field of many micro treatment spots, on the other hand, offers a new standard of treatment which goes beyond the limitations of traditional technology. However, the study process of taking many biopsy samples from patient is impossible; it may cause serious skin injury to the patient. Unlike the data derived from using human skin biopsies, the use of a substitute material enables the collection of data for constructing a three-dimensional (3-D) volumetric heat distribution profile. It is not only provided better statistical accuracy but it also offers a solution to ethical problems. As such, this technology promises to speed up the development of fractional skin thermolysis (FST) technology. Building on our previous research using liquid egg white a substitute material which showed an effective microscopic heat profile of fractional 1550 nm, this research used a solid jelly testing material prepared from egg white, table salt and agar. The jelly was transparent and had the same electrical conductivity as normal saline. The material was tested by means of four types of FST equipment widely used today, and enabled an observation of a 3-D pattern in the jelly immediately after the experiment was conducted. The study also demonstrated an energy distribution over the treatment field which had hither to never been studied.",

The welds were fully characterized by means of metallography, microhardness and tensile test. It can be concluded that when the welding speed and defocus amount remain unchanged, the width and penetration of two weld beads increase with the increase of laser power. Uniform thin lathy martensite was found in the weld seam, which may have something to do with the preheating by the first scan and the effect of heat treatment of the second pass laser. Residual austenite and a small amount of carbides were found in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The microhardness of weld seam and HAZ are all higher than the base metal. Dimple and cleavage steps feature were easy to be found from the fractograph of the tensile samples, which can be concluded that ductile-brittle compound fracture was reached.",

The results showed that the simulation results of the channel were basically similar to the actual results. In addition, from the perspective of anti-electromagnetic interference performance, the larger the interference to signal ratio was, the greater the symbol error rate of the channel was. The experimental results verifies the reliability of channel simulation, which can provide a good theoretical basis for UAV communication research.

We propose 16 Ternary Galois Field Expansions (TGFE) using these literals and three new types of Ternary Galois Field Decision Diagrams (TGFDD) using the proposed expansions, which are useful for reversible and quantum logic design. We also propose a heuristic for creating optimal Kronecker TGFDD and methods for flattening the TGFDDs for determining near-minimum TGFSOP expressions. Besides, we propose quantum realizations for the 5 ternary Shift gates and a ternary swapgate. We also propose a new generalization of ternary Toffoli gates with their implementation from truly realizable 2-qudit quantum primitives. Further, we propose a method of synthesizing multi-output TGFSOP using cascade of ternary Shift gates, Swapgate, and generalized Toffoli gate. Finally, we present experimental results to show the complexity of the decision diagrams, the resultant TGFSOP expressions, and the new quantum cascade for some ternary benchmark functions.",

It is therefore vital to fully understand the nature of the heat loss mechanisms. This paper describes the thermal performance of a new low-cost solar thermal micro-concentrating collector (MCT), which uses linear Fresnel reflectors, and is designed to operate at temperatures up to 200°C. The modules of this collector system are approximately 3.2 meters long by 1.2 meter wide and 0.3 meters high. The numerical and experimental study of combined laminar natural convection and surface radiation heat transfer in the cavity receiver of the MCT is presented. This paper describes the numerical and experimental investigation of the collector heat losses at inclinations varying from 0 to 40°, and absorber temperatures ranging from 70°C to 200°C. In addition to measurements of overall heat loss, particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) was used to visualize the flow field within the enclosure. Excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement of the flow field is achieved between the experiment and that predicted by the computational model. A three-dimensional simulation model for combined natural convection and surface radiation is also developed.",

The present paper presents experimental results obtained when laser welding Al-Mg-Si sheets in a T-joint configuration (a widely used configuration in aircraft construction) with a Nd:YAG laser. By applying the experimental designs method it is possible to define quantitatively the parameters that produce a T-joint with adequate mechanical properties and prevent hot cracking – a phenomenon that frequently occurs in the laser welding of theses alloys. The experimental approach involved two welding techniques: a sequential one, with a successive movement of the laser beam along each side of the assembly; and a simultaneous welding technique, with two beams moving simultaneously on both sides of the assembly. The two methods gave different results in terms of seam penetration but not in terms of ultimate tensile load. In addition, an empirical model was established for the ultimate tensile load of the seams and a technological window for high tensile properties T-joint was determined: welding speeds between 4 and 5 m/min where fractures were recorded in the base material and a filler wire volume of 0.65 to 0.78 mm3 per mm of weld. The experimental design method allows one to find a more efficient way of determining the optimal domain for complex processes.",

    "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) is considered one of the most important ceramic materials used for several industrial sectors because of its physical, chemical and mechanical properties. However, the progress of SiC is limited by the high defect density of the substrate. In addition, the difficulties in the processing steps necessary for full-scale production. Thus, the need for epitaxial layers of SiC is favored. The epitaxial layers of SiC are used to improve the properties of the chosen substrate. Recently, nanostructured SiC thin films received great attention due to their superior properties in comparison with bulk SiC. Several deposition techniques were used to deposit SiC thin films. Among these, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) appears as a potential technique for the deposition of nanostructured SiC films. It offers unique advantages over other competing deposition techniques such as high deposition rate over a wide range of depositing temperatures, complex stoichiometry film deposition, flexibility and relatively inexpensive. This paper highlights the different deposition techniques of SiC thin films with much emphasis on PLD process beside the SiC properties and applications.",

But as we move on from one technology generation to the other leakage is increasing to an unavoidable extent not only during the standby mode but also during the run time. Earlier leakage power was minimized only for the circuit in standby mode because in active condition the percentage of leakage power was insignificant compared to dynamic power and run time considered about the reduction of dynamic power only but now that is not the case. It has become essential to reduce leakage parameters during the operation of a circuit. Minimum feature sizes, low power consumption, minimum cost and high performance have become the key characteristics of any electronic component. This paper focuses on designing SRAM based array consisting of MTCMOS applied 7T SRAM as its basic unit cell and a comparison has been done with the array comprising of simple 7T SRAM based array without any techniques. The array formed is 4×4 array with a storing capacity of 16 bits.

The obtained layers were identified as Cr-Fe alloy with a hardness increased by a factor of 1.4 to 2.6 with respect to the steel substrate. This result is attributed to the thermal load and cooling rate experienced by the surface and to a solid solution effect due to the high chromium content.

    "abstract": "Laser-assisted high speed milling is a subtractive machining method that employs a laser beam to thermally soften material’s surface in order to enhance machinability at high material removal rate with improved surface finish and tool life. Ultrasonic-assisted milling is an advanced manufacturing technology where ultrasonic source is connected with cutting tool, that has demonstrated effectiveness in terms of acquiring good surface topography and high surface finish. Despite this, its application is limited at low speed and is not widely applied for high volume production. Here, an ultrasonic-induced droplet delivery method is employed as an efficient method for laser-assisted high speed milling operation. In this study the effect of ultrasonic-induced droplet cutting fluid on surface roughness and flank wear of 6082 aluminium alloy is experimentally investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) and the results are compared with the conventional droplet cutting fluid. The ultrasonic creates acoustic streaming, acoustic cavitation as well as cavitation bubbles in the cutting fluid. This acoustic energy is able to increase the local temperature of cutting fluid with which the laser power combinedly softens the machined surface, thereby reducing the tool abrasion and surface roughness. The results show a favourable reduction in surface roughness and flank wear by 11.04 and 1.37%, respectively, in comparison to conventional droplet cutting fluid. Clearly, the laser-assisted high speed milling with ultrasonic-induced droplet cutting fluid will be applicable in high production rate manufacturing where it will yield less production time, low operating cost and, at the same time, give better surface finish and longer tool life.",

The influence of the duty cycle and the irradiated spot diameter on temperature rise is examined in details. A numerical model incorporating the final element method (FEM) model is introduced to predict temperature filed inside the irradiated substrate material. It is found that the effect of duty cycle on temperature rise is significant; in which case, increasing duty cycle results in attainment of high temperature at the irradiated surface. Increasing irradiated spot diameter enhances temperature rise at the irradiated spot centre. In this case, heat diffusion is suppressed by the attainment of low temperature gradient in the radial direction and the internal energy gain by the substrate material due to absorption of the incident radiation enhances temperature rise at the surface. Local melting occurs for low duty cycles, which in turn results in wavy appearance of the melted region along the laser scanning direction at the surface. Increasing duty cycle and irradiated spot diameter enhances the melt width size at the surface. The consecutive laser pulses gives rise to temperature rippling at the irradiated surface, which is more pronounced for low duty cycles and small irradiated spot diameter.",

It is built on the basis of industrial Nd:YAG laser with an average power of up to 500 W, equipped with a specially designed feeder, in its original construction. The feeder allows feeding a filler wire of 0.8 mm and up in diameter into the welding area, within a wide speed range in both continuous and pulsed modes. The characteristics of laser welding of aluminium alloys such as Al-1050, Al-6061, Al-2024, Al-4047 and widely used structural and stainless steels such as AISI 304, with and without a filler wire, were studied. The processing methods that can be applied to exclude the formation of micro-cracks and pores in pulsed laser welding were determined. In particular, it was shown, that the application of a fibre optic can change the energy distribution of the laser beam that, in some cases, has a positive effect on the laser welding quality. The optimal groove shape and size designed for laser welding with wire feed, has been also determined. A simple mathematical model for the determination of the operation parameters of laser welding is presented. It is shown that the model allows predicting the laser welding results with sufficient accuracy. The welding processing parameters, depending on the type and thickness of the welded materials, were calculated.",

    "abstract": "With the increasingly competitive nature of industry today it is very critical for organizations that supply chains continue to work as planned, with smooth and uninterrupted flows of materials from initial suppliers through to final customers. For an efficient supply chain management, risks should be identified, analyzed and managed accurately throughout the whole supply chain. Particularly, warehouse processes in supply chain operations contain risks to consider which lead to a poor supply chain performance. Therefore, risk assessment has been an important task for warehouse management. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a suitable method for identifying all failure modes within a system, assessing their impact, and planning for corrective action. The traditional FMEA determines the risk priorities of failure modes, which require the risk factors like the occurrence (O), severity (S) and detection (D) of each failure mode to be evaluated. However, it has some drawbacks so that affect the risk evaluation and correction action. It is very difficult for three risk factors to be evaluated precisely. Additionally, traditional FMEA doesn’t consider the relative importance of three risk factors. In this paper, a risk assessment model using fuzzy FMEA method is proposed to evaluate the risks of warehouse operations. The rating of three factors is expressed as triangular fuzzy number and the relative importance among O, S and D is also considered as triangular number with respect to the judgments of experts. For defuzzification, α-cut and satisfactory index β are used in the model. The proposed model is applied to determine the most critical failure modes for warehouse operations of a food retail distributor in Turkey.",

A CSFS possesses a broader and more flexible structure to effectively model the uncertainty for decision-making (DM) problems.

Furher, we investigate some crucial properties of these aggregation operators. These aggregation operators play a key role to provide an optimal solution in aggregation process. In addition, we state a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach and algorithm to handle the complex spherical fuzzy information. To exhibit the applicability of proposed approach, we provide a numerical example related to the selection of most suitable chemical industry to purchase chemicals for establishing a paint company.

Initially, transient temperature distribution in the thin sheet of Inconel 718 is simulated which is further utilized to predict the hole taper, heat affected zone (HAZ) and material removal rate (MRR). The predicted values of hole taper have been compared with the self conducted experimental values. It is found that the increase of pulse width and peak power increases the hole taper, HAZ and MRR whereas the increase of pulse frequency reduces the hole taper and extent of HAZ but enhances the MRR. It has also been observed that the thickness of sheet play a vital role in determining the quality of a laser drilled hole.",

This study investigated the effect of firing temperature on the metal to ceramic bond strength of porcelain fused to metal restoration of a Co–Cr alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The specimens were fused to porcelain according to ISO 9693:1999 standard at the firing temperature that is increased from 915 to 935°C by a step size of 5°C. Three-point bending tests were carried out to measure the bond strengths. The results show that the maximum bond strength is 49.2 MPa at the firing temperature of 930°C for the SLM porcelain fused to metal restoration. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicates that protruding structure formed in SLM process enhances bond strength by forming mechanical locking structure. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicates that the firing temperature influences bond strength by changing the interfacial bond thickness. At the optimum firing temperature of 930°C, the largest thickness is about 2.0 μm. This findings shows that the SLM metal to ceramic system exhibited a bond strength that can meet the requirement of ISO 9693:1999(E).",

The residual stress of the Nd:YAG laser thermal sprayed Al coating was measured using an XRD stress tester. The effects of LTS on the salt spray corrosion (SSC) of the Al coating are discussed using a SSC test regime and the electrochemical performance of Al coating was also analysed. The results show that the Fe in the S355 steel was diffused into the Nd:YAG laser thermal sprayed Al coating, the intermetallic compound of Fe–Al is formed at the coating interface. The residual stress of the Nd:YAG laser thermal sprayed Al coating enhances its corrosion resistance. The Al oxides are generated on the Al coating, which hinders the corrosion ions into the Al coating and further improves its corrosion resistance. The passivation zone of Al coating shifts positively, indicating that the Al coating on the S355 steel has better corrosion resistance.",

    "abstract": "The task of minimizing the downtime of a data center is becoming increasingly important due to the necessity of availability, and maintaining the integrity of the data being handled. However, the prediction of the dynamic response of air temperatures during a failure, which can be used for mitigation options such as equipment shutdown, is not an easy task for most facilities. The data center section considered consists of 10 racks of servers, with maximum capacity of 28 kW for each rack. The racks are cooled using cold air supplied through computer room air-conditioning (CRAC) units. Prior to discharge from each rack, the heated air is cooled using an air-to-water rear door heat exchanger (RDHX) utilizing chilled water circulated from the building chiller. Measured data are presented following two chiller pump failure scenarios in the data center zone of interest. The data include CRAC supply and return air temperatures, chiller supply and return water temperature, chilled water flow rate, total server power draw, and CRAC fan speeds. The first failure event was unregulated, during which the data center can be viewed as a control mass. The second failure event was regulated manually using various methods, during which the data center can be perceived as a control volume. As a secondary objective, the paper presents a simple analysis based on overall energy balance to provide estimate of an average temperature rise based on an estimated thermal mass of the system following the first cooling system failure.",

It is capable of producing quality end-use parts direct form computer-aided design (CAD) files, without the need for any further intermediate processing or complex tooling. Material consolidation is through solid state sintering, without long range flow or transport of liquid phases. The fusion behaviour of the powder material during SLS affects the morphology, dimensional accuracy and properties of the part. As a result, the range of materials commercially used for SLS is limited, in spite of numerous advantages. There is a growing research interest as several polymer material alternatives are being investigated including polymers, Nano-polymer composites, metal polymer composites, etc. The current research looks at biocomposite materials as possible options for SLS. While reviewing the current research and the future trends, the paper also presents results of experiments conducted with specific biopolymer composites, including wood-polymer and ceramic-polymer combinations. Evaluation of micrographs reveal promising results and plausible rheological changes with varying process conditions and compositions.",

After heat treatment, the molten pool boundaries and the dendrites disappears, the austenite grains grow, and the grain is mainly composed of columnar crystals that grow parallel to the direction of heat flow after HT at 1050℃, and there is an obvious texture in the <101> direction. After solution treatment at 1150℃, the grain is mainly composed of equiaxed grains, and the texture is no longer obvious. The small-angle grain boundaries at 0 to 10° after 1050℃ solution treatment account for about 80% of the total grain boundaries, Σ3 CSL is the most in low-ΣCSL. Compared with the solution treatment at 1050℃, the grain growth was obvious at 1150℃, the content of low-ΣCSL increased obviously, the grain boundary energy of low-ΣCSL was lower than that of the random boundary, the corrosion resistance was enhanced. The small-angle grain boundary of the sample cross-section decreases, the large-angle grain boundary increases and the twin crystals appear, in which the increase of the large-angle grain boundary is the most obvious with the difference of the misorientation angle of 60°, which is mainly <111>/60° twin boundaries, which belongs to the Σ3 CSL boundaries.",

    "abstract": "We propose a detailed analysis of a novel two-dimensional (2-D) photonic crystal (PhC) structure to envisage a highly sensitive pressure sensor in the infrared (IR) wavelength range by using an IR laser source. The sensing performances are evaluated by separately designing the proposed structure on InAs and ZnO substrate. The sensor configuration is realized with the arrangement of circular air holes in the triangular lattice configuration having a central line defect. The mainstay of the present research is to study the variation in photonic band gap (PBG) using plane wave expansion (PWE) technique with respect to change in pressure from 1 to 5 GPa across the structure. In addition to this, the transmission spectrum is investigated for different applied pressures in both the InAs and ZnO-based structures. Vital sensing performance like sensitivity and quality factors are computed by analysing the shifting nature of the resonant mode wavelength in the transmission spectrum. We observed a remarkable sensitivity of 75 and 40 nm/ GPa for the proposed InAs-based and ZnO-based PhC sensor, respectively. Also, the effect of different normalized air hole radius is thoroughly studied on the variation in the band gap size. A comparative analysis of the sensor outcomes with respect to the previously published works is presented to prove the superiority of the present research.",

The Laplace transformation method is used to solve the governing heat equation with relevant boundary and initial conditions. The Dawson’s integral method is adapted to inverse the Laplace solution to the physical plane. Temporal variation of temperature in the irradiated region is computed for various laser pulse lengths by using the closed form solution of temperature field derived in this study. It is found that temperature rise in the early heating period is rapid because of the internal energy gain from the irradiated laser field and attainment of low temperature gradient in this region during the early heating period. Temperature decay is fast at the surface in the early cooling period, which is particularly true for laser long pulses. Temperature decays sharply in the region next to the surface vicinity, which is more pronounced for long laser pulses. Increased temperature gradient enhances heat diffusion from the surface region towards the solid bulk. In the case of laser short pulse lengths, temperature decay below the surface remains gradual because of the attainment of the low temperature gradients below the surface.",

For Beethoven’s “Fur Elise”, we set up a fuzzy system comprising 150 interpretation rules. Its input is the information contained in the score of a piece of piano music; its output is a MIDI file that represents an interpretation of this music. The level of interpretation reached so far is still well below the standard of an experienced pianist, but well above a merely mechanical rendering of the score. We discuss possible practical uses of our system, possible further developments, and demonstrate the use of advanced fuzzy strategies.",

In this study, pairwise comparisons, will be analyzed under an incomplete data environment where a DM gives one full row of a pairwise comparison matrix. This study starts with incomplete linguistic judgments. After a correction to an existing completion process is provided, the accuracy and therefore effectiveness of the completed data is studied by introducing an accuracy measure whilst a comparative consistency analysis is also conducted to assess the acceptability of the method. Hence an even broader use of analytical decision-making tools is aimed by contributing to shorten the application time and showing compelling accuracy of the method.",

The introduction of hole in the cantilever shifts the neutral axis of the beam and changes the stiffness of the beam thereby varying the displacement which in turn increases the strain and generated voltage. An analytical model of the proposed harvester is developed using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The effect of thickness of the trapezoidal hole on the fundamental natural frequency and the generated voltage is analyzed. The characteristics of the energy harvester are assessed through analytical model and experimental analysis and the outcomes are in close agreement. The cropped harvester with hole thickness of 4.5 mm has bandwidth of 207 Hz. 42% improvement in the harvested power than that of trapezoidal cantilever without hole is achieved. The paper presents the development of a trapezoidal cantilever that performs well when compared to the other cantilevers that are reported in literature making the device suitable for portable electronics applications.

The lower results obtained with the bulk heterojunction are rather attributed to a too intimate mixture of the donor and acceptor molecules giving rise to too small donor and acceptor domain size. In order to circumnavigate this problem, alternated donor-acceptor multilayer devices have been realised that show photovoltaic properties attributable rather to a bulk heterojunction than to stacked cells. Optimisation of these structures is more sensible to the number of bilayers and the sublimation growth rate than to the thickness of each layer.",

To shorten the duration of a thermal fatigue test and improve its reliability, apparatus was designed using a laser as the heat source, considering the good controllability and high energy density of a laser in both time and space. The temperature and stress fields induced by a laser under high temperature cycling were investigated by a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element method (FEM) model. Results show that, under the cyclic action of the laser, pulse compressive stresses were produced and were non-uniformly distributed on the cast iron surface, providing essential conditions for cracking. After 1000 thermal cycles, network cracks occurred on the surface area irradiated by the laser. It is believed that the cracks initiated from holes formed by the spalling of graphite, and propagated to connect with each other under the effects of the pulsed compressive stresses.",

    "abstract": "The creation of collision-free paths for mobile robots, also known as the path planning problem, is a vibrant research field of robotics. Most related approaches for robotic teams display an increment of their total complexity due to the cooperative tasks that must be simultaneously achieved such as forming specific patterns. In addition, these methods extensively bind resources of the system in order to be fully functional and thus, no further tasks could be performed. In this paper, a path planning approach based on Cellular Automata (CA) is introduced. The proposed method assumes that a predefined distance must be covered by a team of robots while preserving their initial formation through cooperations. Due to its simplicity, the resulted computational burden permits the implementation of different methods in the same system in order to accomplish further tasks including image processing techniques. The usage of multiple digital cameras is one of the most interesting aspects of the image processing research area; nevertheless, in mobile robotics, miniature robots are equipped with low resolution cameras constraining the range of image processing applications. In order to preserve the total computational burden and produce higher resolution images, a CA-based image resizing method is inserted in the same cooperative robot system. Higher resolution images could be further processed to attain area measurements, panoramic images etc. Exploiting the inherit parallelism of the CA, both approaches could be executed concurrently. Results indicate that the total CA architecture outcomes low computational cost leading to an appropriate scheme for miniature robots functionality while both paths are properly created and the resolution of the captured images is sufficiently increased.",

Domination is one of the most important issue in graph theory and has found many applications for the formulation and solution of many problems in various areas of science and technology exemplified by computer networks, artificial intelligence, combinatorial analyses, coding theory, etc. The concept of domination has been extended to fuzzy graphs, and vague graphs, to just name a few. We discuss here different concepts and properties related to domination in vague graphs such as an edge dominating set, an edge independent set, regular dominating set, regular independent set, and global dominating set, with some examples. Finally, we show an application of domination in vague graphs in the field of medicine that is related to the Influenza vaccine.",

Classical Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is the most used method for this purpose in the literature. However, it handles a small number of parameters and assigns them equal weights. To overcome this inadequacy, we introduce a more comprehensive FMEA method which allows to assign different weights to the risk parameters. The new FMEA model includes nine risk parameters each having a different weight obtained from CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method. The paper also introduces a fuzzy version of the proposed CRITIC Based Weighted Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (CBW-FMEA) method, which employs triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. All the proposed models are applied to COVID-19 blood testing process and the results are presented comparatively.",

    "abstract": "The shortest path problem (SPP) in graph theory is the problem of assessing a path between two vertices in a graph to minimize the sum of the weights of the edges of its constituent. The SPP ia classical and elementry problem of a graph theory which is applicable in many fields like GIS network analysis, computational geometry, operational research and graph algorithms. SPP are among the elementry problems studied in network optimization. Graphs are very important models of networks. Path-solutions, including location-based services and web-based GIS services, are becoming an important component of many GIS applications. In this paper, we introduced a new method to solve SPP in a network. The SPP is fundamental problems in network optimization. Most traditional solutions for path-finding depends on the shortest path algorithms which tend to minimize travel cost between points. These algorithms use cost criteria which are generally the edge attribute of the graph network. There is a neutrosophical shortest path study in this paper with a vague neutrosophic number (VNsN) on a network. A suggested algorithm also provides the shortest path length (SPL) from source vertex to destination vertex with the ranking function. Here, a VNsN is allocated to each arc length. Lastly, there is a numerical example showing the method proposed.",

Two basic adjustments of the method have been identified (adjusted formula, unified conversion rule). The results show that there is a gain when using the adjusted method, which is observed for pessimists or optimists or for the volatile case, but only if it contains a predominance of optimistic (or pessimistic) estimations. The adjusted method can be used within the teams that experience a bias in their estimations, e.g. because of the customer that has strict time expectations.",

    "abstract": "Materials for integrated optics are glasses, electro-optical crystals or some materials with nonlinear properties. Compared with fiber optics communication lines, integrated optics devices are short so which results in a reduction in the energy losses in direct waveguides. The high level of integration results in very sharp bending of the waveguides. Therefore, bending losses become the dominant ones. In the case of so called pure bending loss, which is the tunneling of the modal field to a propagation region outside the bend, the usual measures against this power transfer are offsetting, coherent coupling and the phase front acceleration. No one of them is perfect, but the last one could be the best. The difficulties in implementation of this method are high gradients in the index of refraction and very thin layers of gradient optics elements which are necessary for the wave front correction.We propose a simple technological solution which can help to reach minimum possible bending loss with relatively small gradient of the refraction index. The calculated optimized gradient is applied to the whole set of parallel waveguides in the bending instead of the individual phase front correction in every waveguide. The second half of the bending loss problem is the transient loss caused by radiation modes excited by sharp changes in the radius of curvature. For this case the best configuration of the waveguide bending is proposed and compared with other configurations. In both cases the theoretical minimum of the bending loss is defined.",

But the present approach yields a system of ODE’s for all the parameters whatever be the form of governing pulse, which are then integrated numerically. The present situation can be used either to explain the effect of polarization mode dispersion or the simple phenomena of pulse interaction in an optical fiber. Our analysis clearly indicates to the fact that PMD tends to destroy the pulse shape as it propagates. On the other hand nonlinearity acts as a trapping mechanism to restore the form. Detailed structure of chirp, width amplitude, phase are given. Also the behaviour of the centre of pulse shows the position of scattering. It may further be added that for some parameter values the solitons collide three, four times and more, which shows that the two are trapped with each other or are formed into a bound state.",

The finite volume method (FVM) is used to discretize the differential governing conservation equations, which are numerically solved. The solid-air and liquid-air interfaces are tracked by implementation of the volume of fluid (VOF) method, whereas an enthalpy approach allows to take into account the melting and re-solidification phenomena. The cut formation is simulated by inserting the related laser deposited energy, for the considered beam distribution, as a volumetric source term in the energy conservation equation, the results show that the used beam distribution may play an important role in reducing the striation formation.",

Using a method of calibrating the circular structured light of a planar target, the equation of the circular structured light surface in the camera coordinate system is obtained. According to the measurement principle of structured light, the inner wall of the reservoir culvert is scanned by laser to obtain three-dimensional (3-D) information on the surface, and the position and size of the obstacles within the culvert are determined. The results show that the calibration error of circular structured light is less than 0.1 mm, which fulfils the requirements of obstacle detection in reservoir culverts. The obstacle detection method based on circular structured light can simultaneously detect the spatial position and size of obstacles inside the reservoir culvert, and the detection error rate is less than 5%, which is generally lower than that of other obstacle detection methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can be applied to the detection of obstacles inside reservoir culverts.",

However, implementation of allpass (AP) signal needs a unity gain inverter. The active and passive sensitivity figures are inferior to unity. PSPICE simulation results confirming the theoretical results are included.",

    "abstract": "Conventional motion estimation algorithms extract motion vectors from image sequences based on the image’s local-brightness differences in consecutive images. Therefore, motion vectors are extracted along the moving edges formed by moving objects over their background. However, in the case of “textureless” moving objects, motion vectors inside the objects cannot be detected because no brightness (texture) differences exist inside the object. Severe issues may incur in motion-related imaging applications because motion-vectors of vast (inner) regions of textureless objects can not be detected, although the inner part is moving with the object’s edges. To solve this problem, we propose an unconventional image-processing algorithm that generates spatial textures based on object’s edge information, allowing the detection of the textures motion. The model is represented by a 2-D crossbar array of a 1-D reaction-diffusion (RD) model where 1-D spatial patterns are created inside objects and aggregated to form textures. Computer simulations confirm the approach, showing the formation of textures over approaching objects, which may open applications in machine vision and automated decision systems.",

The results show that LSP could obviously improve the fatigue life of all laser welded joints, but there were significantly different fatigue fracture characteristics between the two types of laser welded joints. The fatigue cracks initiated at undercuts in the single-side remelting specimens, no matter LSP was applied or not, but LSP retarded the initiation and propagation of cracks. While in the dual-side remelting specimens, the fatigue crack sources shifted from welded spatters on surface to weld pores inside of specimen after LSP, due to the balance between compressive residual stresses on surfaces and tensile residual stresses around weld pores.",

Experiments have shown that the designed sensor has a linearity of 0.999, and a repeatability of greater than 274.5 K within the range of 323 K–443 K. Second, a rotor temperature test system with designed sensor was built; the test results showed that the error between the test results and simulation results was less than 8%, which verified the feasibility and validity of the presented method. Furthermore, introducing an all-optical signal into the motor’s measurement field, this method was characterized by good fitness, immunity to electromagnetic interference, good explosion-proof performance, high accuracy, dynamic measurement, etc. Therefore, this method could be widely applied to the motor measurement field.",

In these systems, there is a fixed number of items to be administered to students. This implies that all students must answer the same number of questions, independently of their knowledge level. By contrast, adaptive testing systems are able to make more accurate predictions of student knowledge level with shorter tests, by choosing the most adequate item to ask next, depending on the current estimation of student knowledge level. In order to be reliable, adaptive testing requires a well-founded underlying theory. The theory mainly used is the Item Response Theory. On the other hand, items that usually appear in adaptive tests have a simple and maybe boring format: a stem and a set of answers. In this paper, a library of templates for the automatic construction of more sophisticated items is presented. These types of items are used in SIETTE, an adaptive web-based system for knowledge assessment by means of tests. This system also provides the capability of generating isomorphic items. With the same mechanism used in the construction of this library, SIETTE has been provided with the capability of restricting the time consumed by students while taking tests.",

However, all these functions can be fully exploited in liquid crystal cells by a proper cell construction as well as a proper choice of materials and by tailoring their properties. The key significance in those systems posses the liquid crystal molecules. An unique property of low-molar mass liquid crystals is their ability for changing the effective index of refraction as a result of an action of electric field or interaction with photochromic molecules.

It has a non-linear combiner where two non-linear blocks along with a linear block are linearly combined to produce the key-streams. Unlike Non-linear Feedback Shift Register (NFSR) based non-linear combiners, it combines 128- bit blocks using parallel evolution of Cellular Automata (CA) and small CA based S-boxes. The usage of CA prevents the correlation attack and two layers of re-usable small S-boxes prevent the algebraic attacks. The stream cipher takes 128 bits Key and 128 bits of Initial Vector (IV). Theoretically, the cipher operates with an encryption speed of nearly 8 bits per cycle. The initialization process needs 96 cycles which is much faster than Grain and Trivium. This stream cipher is extensible in terms of Key size and provides configurable security and vendor specific implementation option. On implementation, the presented cipher receives higher throughput than the existing standards. The security analysis of the cipher is performed and presented in this paper.",

The first model has fuzzy constraints in addition to the classical shortest path problem. The weights of arcs which form objective function are also fuzzy in the second model. To solve the models, a hybrid algorithm consists of fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm is developed. To demonstrate the applicability of these proposed models and algorithms, some illustrating examples are given using a sample network.

The transient spatial densification itself can be described with a thermo-kinetic model of the sintering process which is strongly determined from the local transient temperature history within the sintered part. The required thermophysical data: density ρ, specific heat cp, and thermal conductivity λ have to be determined for a “material in progress” regarding that a sintering material is a continuously transforming material. The measurement of thermal density and specific heat intrinsically capture the significant densification of the sintered material and the thermal response thereof. The use of flash methods to determine the thermal diffusivity requires the exact knowledge of the actual thickness of the measured sample. The shrinkage of the sample has to be taken into account to obtain sufficient diffusivity data. Hence for diffusivity measurements a temperature history regarding to the production routine is used. Transient shrinkage is calculated from a kinetic model which is established from a set of dilatometer measurements performed with geometrically stepped heating rates. Thus obtained corrected data representing thermal diffusivity correlated with the actual density of the part during sintering. Based on this optimized thermophysical data, a realistic transient temperature field can be calculated. This provides a significant improvement in the through process- modelling of any powder-metallurgical based technology. Maximum correction of diffusivity data at maximum sintering temperature was about 50% referred to the corrected value.",

In various disciplines, methods about the solutions-termed TNTOP can have shown promising performance from different types of detection, at different conditions. Due to the limitations of the calculation speed of traditonal algorithms, it is rare that a simple unmodified method provides complete techniques of tackling large-scale TNTOP. We use the term P systems to solve the above limitations. Specifically, it is a tissue-like P system with four cells based on particle swarm algorithm, referred to as MPSO. In this system, the modified prim algorithm and the position-updated mechanism are adopted to generate and update all particle individuals, velocity-updated mechanism and an exchange-tree strategy are adopted to balance exploration and exploitation processes. Besides, some special strategies are also added to this systems. Numerous experiments are presented to verify the performance of the MPSO. The results show that it can generate the individuals of higher quality in shorter computation time when comparing to other benchmark algorithms. These empirical results validate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm in solving TNTOP in terms of both quality and speed.",

Dramatic regression of ovarian and breast cancerous tumors was observed signifying efficient ultrasound-triggered drug release from tumor-accumulated nanodroplets. No therapeutic effect from the nanodroplet/ultrasound combination was observed without the drug, indicating that therapeutic effect was induced by the ultrasound-enhanced chemotherapeutic action of the tumortargeted drug, rather than the mechanical or thermal action of ultrasound itself.

    "abstract": "In the present communication, self-focusing of high power laser beam in underdense plasma and its effect on second harmonic generation is investigated by taking in to account the combined effect of relativistic and ponderomotive nonlinearity. There is redistribution of carriers on account of combined effect of relativistic and ponderomotive nonlinearity. As a result, a transverse density gradient gets established in plasma, which results in to excitation of electron plasma wave at pump wave frequency. Excited electron plasma wave in turn interacts with pump beam thereby generating second harmonic of incident laser beam. The differential equation governing the evolution of spot size of laser beam has been derived by making use of paraxial ray approximation and has been solved numerically. Effects of variation in intensity of laser beam, plasma density, plasma temperature and combined effects of relativistic and ponderomotive nonlinearites on beam width parameter of laser beam as well as second harmonic yield are also analyzed.",

All-optical orientation provided by mutiphotonic interaction is performed in guest-host polymers containing multifunctional chromophores with fluorescent, photoisomerizable and nonlinear properties. Polarization-resolved two-photon fluorescence measurements are a convenient tool to explore the even order parameters of the molecular orientational distribution after orientation, with, in addition, a high sensitivity to inter-molecular interactions. In the case of high concentration polymers, we show that the excitation transfer between chromophores strongly influences the two-photon fluorescence polarization response of optically poled areas, resulting in a loss of anisotropy and polarization-sensitivity. Through polarization-resolved optical poling experiments conducted on polymer films doped with various concentrations of a dye laser (DCM), we investigate the competition between the different non-radiative processes such as excitation transfer and photochemical mechanisms involved in the molecular orientation.",

Then the experimental data also show that the ray decentration-induced intensity attenuation of the laser is much severer than the ray tilting-induced. According to these characteristics, a real-time control system based on an improved angle controller is designed to eliminate mirror misalignment in terms of practical operation of ring laser gyros. In temperature experiments (-40 to 60ºC), the optical intensity attenuation decreases from 37 to 14% with this system.",

Here, 200 nm thick YBCO microbridges were machined with a femtosecond laser (300 fs at 1030 nm wavelength) as a chemical-free and flexible method with minimal edge damage. Transport measurements and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyse the bridges before and after laser processing. While transport and Raman measurements are commonly used separately to evaluate YBCO, our approach links both techniques to analyse laser-induced damage. The link between changes in the Raman spectrum and transport measurements is investigated by identifying changes caused by repeated heat treatments while sequentially measuring the critical current density and Raman spectra. The data obtained is used to predict critical current density losses from changes in Raman peak intensities and shifts. This technique is further investigated by applying it to laser machined YBCO bridges which were exposed to highly localised heating. Results show that for bridge widths of 10 μm, a femtosecond laser can be used to repeatedly successfully machine microbridges with no loss in critical current density and that there is some correlation to critical current changes in the Raman spectra.",

The inherent non-repetitiveness of the technique makes mandatory a closed-loop control of the process when homogeneous results are required, since it is affected by the material, size, and geometry of the part. Based on the use of uncooled PbSe image sensors working in the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) range (1 to 5 μm), we present a novel high-speed closed-loop control for LMD. Controlling laser power at high speed (1 kHz) based on measurements from the melt pool thermal image down to 200ºC enhances current solutions based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) images, blind to temperatures under 600ºC. To demonstrate the performance of the controller, claddings on different surfaces and geometries were carried out. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of this approach in terms of sensitivity to process related magnitudes an overall control stability.",

Then the patterned temporary steel substrate is immersed in an electrolytic bath and Cu is deposited onto the steel. It was observed that Cu growth could be completely inhibited in those areas processed by the laser. In a third step, the Cu pattern is laminated or peeled-off from the temporary steel substrate, for example by using laminate dielectrics to create a flexible or hard circuitry. The phenomenon preventing copper growth was associated with micro-segregation of Cr and Mo. This created oxidation or micro-surface potential differences.",

The laser was in Gaussian mode and the calculation for prediction of material removal rate and stress values in the target was conducted on the St37 steel. The analysis allows the investigation of groove depth and stress field for a variety of laser power, cutting speed and pulse frequency. The laser used for this study was 0.15 mm in beam radius with a 10.6 mm wavelength at an intensity range of 200 to 1000 W and repetition rate of 5000 to 10000 Hz. The pulse duration was 10 ms and cutting speed varied from 1 to 2 m/min. Thermal properties of the material was assumed temperature dependent and the birth and death technique of elements was employed for simulation of material removal. Therefore, during the cutting process, if the temperature of any element was greater than the melting point, then the element deactivated and did not participate in the calculation. Applicability of the model under consideration was verified by comparing the result of simulation with experimental data in the relevant literature. The good agreement of results show the validity of the simulation and applicability of the developed finite element (FE) model.",

The results show that unreasonable morphology of flake graphite phase in bond area is an important cause of microcrack initiation and propagation. Their cusps almost cross toward the molten layer and through the bond area. Then the microcrack grows along the grain boundary. Additionally, under condition of certain specific energy input, an appropriate increase in laser power and scanning speed can enhance molten mass convection. It can be also helpful for the distribution rationalization of graphite phase and reduce crack sources. Besides, more reasonable parameter combinations are derived such as collocation of laser power as 2900 to 3100 W and first layer scanning speed as 360 to 420 mm/min. With using these, higher crack toughness and less rigid phase organization can be obtained.",

    "abstract": "Mobile wireless sensor networks involve many aspects not dealt with in traditional networks, and therefore, can be viewed as an unconventional computational model. We design algorithms for mobile wireless sensor networks based on another unconventional model of computation, namely, the biologically-inspired cellular automaton. The main advantage of using cellular-automaton-based algorithms is that they are strictly local algorithms, and as such are more suitable for sensor networks. We design cellular-automaton-based algorithms for three optimization problems in connection with mobile wireless sensor networks. The first problem involves a set of connected sensors that are deployed randomly in a network. The goal of the algorithm is to gather all the sensors at a single location. In the second problem, we are given a set of sensors which form a chain. All sensors except for the two end points of the chain are connected to their two neighbors, right and left. The two end points are fixed and can directly communicate with only one neighbor. Other sensors can move autonomously. At an initial configuration of the network, the chain can be winding and even overlap with itself. Our goal is to move the sensors so that they can come as close as possible to the direct line between the two end points, and while the sensors move the network should remain connected. In the third problem, a number of mobile sensors and mobile objects are deployed randomly in a dense area of the network and are allowed to move within the network. Our main goal is to monitor the mobile objects by the mobile sensors as long as possible. We show that our algorithms perform better than existing algorithms for all three problems.",

    "abstract": "The attempt to determine which is the most frequent cell state in an arbitrary initial configuration of a cellular automaton is quite likely the most well-studied benchmark problem in the context of computational ability of cellular automata. In its standard form, the problem is formulated in terms of a binary cellular automaton, whose action on a finite, one-dimensional lattice, with arbitrary odd-sized length and periodic boundary, would converge to a quiescent configuration of 1s or 0s, according to the respective prevailing bit in the initial configuration. Although extremely simple in formulation, the problem has unveiled a rich web of conceptual connections, which, at the same time, have enlarged and challenged our understanding about how to perform computations within cellular automata. In spite of the fact that the problem as such is knowingly impossible to solve, many proposals have been made in attempting to solve it, perfectly or not, in a variety of forms and generalisations. Here, we summarise the negative results in the context, and survey the main proposals with larger dimensions; higher number of states; fixed boundary conditions; infinite size lattices; asynchronous update schemes; rule changing throughout the temporal evolution; non-uniform cellular automata; memory addition to the rules; and stochastic rules. We also discuss burdens that would need to be overcome in the attempt to characterise the best possible imperfect solution in the standard formulation. The resulting picture clarifies what is known so far about the problem, and what is left to further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Due to both a rapid urbanization trend since the 1950s and development differences between areas, population and investment have been accumulated in certain regions in Istanbul which has led to disordered, unhealthy and unreliable urban areas. Istanbul is located on a seismic belt and is at risk of substantial damage should an earthquake occur due to irregular urbanization. Several transformation projects have started to be implemented with the intention of improving this fearsome picture and to evaluate the damages that would occur in an earthquake. To achieve this, urban transformation plans and projects must be done taking into consideration historical places, areas at risk and small-scale plans. This study is an evaluation of the development of unplanned housing and urban transformation projects during the urbanization process in the Istanbul Historic Peninsula. The peninsula has been an important cultural and civilization centre between Eastern and Western civilizations for centuries and has been listed in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List since 1985. Despite this, no documentation of this important area has yet been carried out. In 2006 the Istanbul Greater Municipality’s Directory of the Protection of Historical Environment initiated the “Historic Peninsula Project”, which comprises a project area of 1500 ha and approximately 48,000 buildings in crowded and narrow streets. Also, this project included the documentation of all buildings in the area of the Historic Peninsula by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in 2006. The most challenging task was to build up a new production environment with modern technology in the very short time frame of two years.",

The feasibility of the method was also evaluated in detail. The obtained results show that grey level is not directly the powder distribution in the jet but rather a projection of this distribution. The powder distribution is an almost symmetrical Gaussian distribution in specific regions. As the powder feeding rate increases, the concentration of the convergence point increases; the carrier gas flow affects the gas and powder flow speed and concentration. The larger the carrier gas flow is, the greater the gas and powder flow speed are, but the concentration decreases, which is consistent with the grey image change law. The change of powder flow behaviour can be mainly attributed to the effect of gas flow rate on the movement tracks of powder particles.",

The charge carrier transport based on this mechanism will be discussed theoretically and compared with the earlier experimental results.

Though the dark hollow region is absent from the Gaussian vortex beam in the source plane, it appears upon propagation. Therefore, the behaviour of the Gaussian vortex beam in the source region is worthy of investigation. By means of mathematical techniques, the analytical expressions for the TE and the TM terms in the source region have been derived without any approximation, in which the propagation and the evanescent parts are separated from each other. The effects of the propagation and the evanescent parts on the vectorial structure are analysed with numerical examples.

Extensive lidar measurements to reveal tropospheric aerosol distribution and its microphysical properties have been realized between 2009 and 2015 at the Gebze station of TÜBITAK Marmara Research Centre (MRC) in Turkey. The lidar system is based on an Nd:YAG laser with its second and third harmonics to measure three backscatter and two extinction coefficients from which particle microphysical parameters such as number, area and volume densities, effective radius, complex refractive index and polarization can be retrieved. The addition of the scanning module to the existing system allowed us to determine the PBL height in larger areas by making scanning measurements with 20° to the horizontal. So, instead of the conventional single column measurements made by the synergistic measurements done by several measurement systems together with the coexistence of a lidar, a scanning lidar system was used to cover wider ranges.",

Samples of the steel sheets were mechanically bent to 120 mm curvatures using a 20 ton capacity eccentric mechanical press at room temperature and also with the laser beam using a 4.4 kW Nd: YAG laser system at a scan speed of 1.9 m/min, beam diameter of 12 mm, laser power of 1.7 kW at 25% beam overlap using argon for cooling the irradiated surfaces. The chemical composition of both the as-received material and the formed samples were analysed by emission spectroscopy to quantify the changes in the elemental composition. The result shows a percentage increase in the carbon after the mechanical and laser forming processes when compared to the parent material. This can be attributed to the enhancement resulting from the forming processes. The formed samples were further characterized through microstructure, microhardness and tensile tests. The microstructural characterisation of the samples revealed that the grains of the mechanically formed and laser formed components are elongated, it was also observed that there is an increase in the pearlite grains of the laser formed components resulting from the thermal heating during the laser process. The microhardness profiles of the formed components showed that there is a significant percentage increase in the Vickers microhardness values of the laser formed samples when compared to the mechanically formed samples and with respect to the parent material. The laser beam forming process can be considered a more appropriate forming process in terms of the resulting material properties in this regard.",

    "abstract": "We explore the computing capacity of large memristor networks in a reservoir computing setup. Memristor networks are modelled as random cellular automata networks. It is inevitable that the cellular automata model does not describe properly certain aspects of memristor dynamics. However, owing to the simplicity of the model one can explore extremely large memristor networks and specifically focus on issues related to the network topology. To investigate the computing capacity of such systems we studied a challenging classification problem. The goal was to distinguish whether a given protein sequence resembles a toxin or not. Different network topologies have been investigated with the overarching goal of understanding how the topology of the memristor network relates to its information processing capacity, and ultimately affects the accuracy of the prediction. We demonstrate the existence of “sweet spots” in the space of network topologies. There are network structures that can generalize very well and are robust with regard to the change in the data set.",

The introduction of CF filler generates a microphase separation in the semi-IPNs studied perhaps due to selective or preferred adsorption of PU onto CF surface. The activation of CF surface by grafting of phosphate groups onto CF surface leads to lower degree of phase separation in filled semi-IPNs perhaps due to competitive chemisorption of forming CPL onto activated filler surface.",

    "abstract": "The stability of the receiving echo in laser tracking was useful for keeping track of targets in their orbits. The reflected signal was affected by the reflection distributing characteristic of the target surface and laser incidence angle. In this paper the bidirectional reflection distributing function (BRDF) was used to analyse the effects of the receiving echo. The bidirectional reflection distribution of target satellite surface was obtained, it contained that the component of diffuse reflection became larger and the component of specular reflection became small as the increase of the target surface roughness. The receiving echo increased as the increase of the component of specular reflection, when the incidence angle was small. The receiving echo power decreased quickly under the bigger incidence angle. When the incidence angle was larger than 34º, the minimum receiving echo power that was computed by the BRDF was lower than the one computed by the lidar formula. At this time, the illuminating laser power should become five-times of the former one or the receiving aperture became 2.5 times of the former one, these methods could remove the effect of decreasing of the receiving echo power. The white coating of thermal control diffuse reflection material and F36 of the multi-cladding specular reflection material were used to do the experiment. The experiments results accorded with the simulation results. The white coating has a big surface roughness, the scanning angle was bigger, and the specular reflection component was small. When the incident angle was smaller than 45º, the receiving echo power that was computed by the BRDF was bigger than one computed by the lidar formula. The multi-cladding has a small surface roughness, the specular reflection component was big. There were no reflected signals ,when the incidence angle was bigger than 2º.",

The glass samples densities were increased and those of the molar volume were decreased by increasing the content of MnO. In addition, the concentration of manganese ions and the related field strength were increased while the corresponding inter-ionic spacing and polaron radius were decreased. The spectroscopic studies of all samples were carried out over (190-2500 nm) spectral range. The optical transmission of the prepared glass in the visible-near IR spectral range is enhanced by increasing the MnO content where it reaches a maximum value of about 86% at concentration 3% of MnO. This excellent transmission in such spectral range suggested the use of the present glass in many technological applications such as modulators and lens applications in the visible band. The optical band gap and the Urbach energies were determined. The refractive index was found to be decreased by increasing the MnO concentration from 1% to 3% then increased by increasing the MnO concentration from 3% to 6%. Other related physical parameters such as dielectric constant, electric susceptibility, molar polarizibility and metallization criterion were evaluated. The results predicted the working of the present glass in the range of nonlinear optical materials.",

For a given DD, the related transform is determined by an analysis of expansion rules used in the nodes and the related labels of edges. The converse task, design of a DD in terms of a given spectral transform is relatively easy to solve for Kronecker product representable spectral transforms. However, in other cases, it appears a problem of decomposition of basic functions in spectral transform to determine the corresponding expansion rules and labels at the edges. We point out that this problem relates to the assignment of nodes in Pseudo-Kronecker DDs (PKDDs). Then, we show that in the case of Haar transform, the expansion rules and assignment of nodes in Haar Spectral transform DDs (HSTDDs) can be determined from a study and comparison of FFT and DD methods for calculation of the Haar spectrum. This consideration permits to generalize the definition of HSTDDs to multiple-valued (MV) functions considered as functions in finite fields or as subsets of complex-valued functions. Conversely, from such defined HSTDDs, we derive various Haar transforms for MV functions related to Fourier series and polynomial expressions for MV functions.",

    "abstract": "After the Industrial Revolution in Europe, manufacturing systems became very important research areas. There are many scheduling problems which are NP-hard in the literature. Several heuristics and dispatching rules have been proposed to solve hard combinatorial optimisation problems. Genetic algorithms (GA) have shown great advantages in solving the combinatorial optimisation problems in view of the fact that they have high efficiency and are fit for practical application. Even though this is a common problem in the industry, only a small number of studies have dealt with non-identical parallel machines. This paper concerns the fuzzy approach to the scheduling problem of non-identical parallel machines using genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithm proposed here fits the non-identical parallel machine scheduling problem of minimising the maximum completion time. Also, fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are excellent tools for representing heuristic, common sense rules, which is why we have tried to use fuzzy systems in this study. The real-life nonidentical parallel machine genetic algorithm application using fuzzy numbers has been performed with a JAVA program.",

    "abstract": "Now days low power devices are getting more attention in electronics field so recent year designers have designed devices in a way that they consumes less power but obstacles are in maintaining parameter like area, total power and leakage power to achieve system goal. Leakage power is attentive parameter to design low power devices because it plays a major role in increasing the Total power consumption of the devices. In this paper 6T SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) has been designed and parameters like Total power and leakage power has been calculated. SRAM is a type of memory that provides a link with CPU and designing of SRAM is very critical because it takes large part of power and area. In SRAM cell, major problem is that it is volatile in nature to avoid this characteristic of SRAM cell in this paper designed Memristor based SRAM. Memristor is a forth missing non-linear resistor which acts as memory. It is invented in 1971 by L. O. Chua and it is nonvolatile in nature this is the reason behind that Memristor based SRAM is nonvolatile in nature. To reduce leakage power and total power of Memristor based 6T SRAM applied MTCMOS (Multi Threshold CMOS) technique. Designing and calculation of parameters of simple SRAM, Memristor based SRAM and MTCMOS based SRAM has been done in 45 nm technologies with the operating voltage of 0.7 volt and that was done with cadence virtuoso tool.",

This paper studies the substructures of white layers induced by microsecond pulsed laser processing of DIN 42CrMo4 alloy steel. Besides recasting morphologies, grinding marks were still retained on both sides of the outer surface of white layers, while the highest temperature in the experiment was above the boiling temperature. Retained microstructural bandings were partially eliminated in white layers. These results indicated that the unmelted material in this process can also be changed to white layers through the solid-state phase transformation. The boundary between the recast zone and the unmelted zone can be regarded as the initial melting point isotherm, which is not that boundary between the entire white layer and the surrounding transition layer. Explanation based on deep welding and granular impact was made to describe the shaping of the white layer.",

It has been abundantly addressed in the case of dipolar molecules under the earlier Langevin-Kielich-Benoit frame, all the way to its subsequent implementation in the realm of quadratic nonlinear optics and there from, into a wealth of more applied electro-optic device applications. In contrast, the issue of non-dipolar molecules, such as octupoles and more generally that of multipolar molecules, had been left aside, whereas the latter are being recognized as the more general pool of candidate nonlinear molecules.

This is the first study which uses EMDRFR hybrid method for wind power forecasting. The performance of the proposed method is tested on real wind power data of one of the pioneering energy companies in Turkey. The proposed model was verified by comparing it with other intelligent models. The experimental results demonstrate that the EMD-RFR model outperforms the single RFR model, the single SVMR model and the EMD- SVMR hybrid model based on different performance measures.",

A study was undertaken to determine the optimum cutting parameters and to quantify their influence on the fatigue strength and depending on the type of microstructure created in two metals: a bearing steel (100Cr6/AISI 52100) and an aeronautical titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V). In the bearing steel a significant increase in the fatigue resistance was observed due to the transformation of the surface layer into martensite. In the titanium alloy, a slight reduction in the fatigue strength was found as in this case the microstructure and residual stress state of the surface layer were less beneficial.

Uncertainty is defined as a situation with inadequate information and includes three types: inexactness, unreliability and ignorance; it is not merely the absence of knowledge. However, uncertainty can still exist in cases where there is a big chunk of information. In this regard, Rough Set Theory (RST) is a powerful mathematical model that deals with uncertain information. The RST offers a practical method for extracting decision rules from datasets. To deal with the uncertainty within the datasets, we initially propose a new hybrid approach that combines RST with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Furthermore, a novel algorithm based on RST (RSTPNN) is proposed by the idea of combining probability based Naive Bayes (NB) and nearest neighbor based K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to efficiently improve the classification performance. For experimental validation, we use 12 different datasets from the Open ML and UCI repositories. The empirical results evidently show that the proposed method may improve classification performance.",

    "abstract": "Personnel selection is the process of choosing among the candidates applying for a defined job in the organization, the ones who have the qualifications required to perform the job in the best way. The selection process, depending on the organization’s targets, the availability of candidates and the individual preferences of the decision makers (DMs), is a highly complex problem. In addition, nature of the personnel selection problem requires both qualitative and quantitative criteria simultaneously. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and the fuzzy set theory are the best two approaches to cope with the multi-criteria nature of the personnel selection problem and vagueness of DMs’ predictions. For this aim, this paper proposes an effective model based on fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) and fuzzy ANP (Analytic Network Process) to help organizations that need to evaluate and select applicants for a described job. The model first applies DEMATEL to cope with the interdependencies between evaluation criteria. Next, it uses the fuzzy ANP to compute weights for each criterion and evaluate applicants. In this paper, a fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP model is proposed for selection of snipers. Every soldier in the team executes different missions and one or two of them are needed to hit with the first shot. 10 criteria are used to evaluate team members. The best two candidates could be assigned as snipers.",

    "abstract": "An extension of Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method is proposed to solve hierarchically structured and Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problems in individual and group decision making environments. Firstly, the data collection phase is enhanced by the use of fuzzy Linguistic Preference Relations (LinPreRa) method to obtain consistent judgments via reducing data collected from decision makers. After simplifying the process of data collection, we aggregate the judgments of decision makers related to importance weights and performance evaluations to obtain weighted normalized fuzzy performance matrix. As a classical step of TOPSIS, fuzzy distances are calculated to negative ideal and positive ideal solutions in order to obtain final ranking (regarding the scores of fuzzy closeness coefficients) for different risk attitudes. We adapted Chakraborty and Chakraborty (2006)’s fuzzy distance method by employing by means of α-cut intervals. A numerical study and a real-life case are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach and the results are compared with previous studies (Wang",

In this study GGG70L ductile cast iron base material (BM) was clad with Metco 42C martensitic stainless steel powder using a high power diode laser (HPDL) laser. The effect of process parameters (laser power, scanning speed and powder flow rate) on clad geometry, porosity and crack formation, and microhardness was investigated. Taguchi experimental design was created via the L9 orthogonal array and analysed by signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and analysis of variance (ANOVA) method for clad geometry. Clad geometry was investigated in terms of clad height, clad width, aspect ratio and clad depth using an optical microscope. Pores in the clad were characterized with an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). Hardness testing of the clad layers was performed on a Vickers microhardness testing machine to create microhardness depth profiles. High laser power increased the risk of crack and pore formation, and led to larger pores. The optimum laser process parameters for the lowest pore and crack formations were a laser power of 1.7 kW, a scanning speed of 10 mm/s and a powder flow rate of 12 g/min.",

In the literature; many studies have been investigated on supply chain performance analysis in uncertainty environment and demand parameter is an essential data on these analyses. When there is sufficient data about demand, it is easy to construct probability distribution of demand. However, in the absence of enough historical data, it is impossible to construct the probability distribution. The demand parameter is intuitively determined and shown by a fuzzy distribution in such situations. This paper intends to find closed form solutions in order to maximize the performance of a two-stage supply chain with coordination under fuzzy environment. The coordination of the supply chain is maintained by contracts. The contracts analysed in this study are revenue sharing contract and buy back contract. Numerical examples are presented to show the validity of the proposed models and to investigate the effect of contract parameters on the total performance of the supply chain.",

The obtained results show that the increases of gate bias effect on substrate lead to decreasing the source resistance for simulated device. The reported increase in the effect of gate induces the increases of transferred holes concentration towards the source region and which induce the decreases of source resistance. The decrease of source resistance can also be made by reducing the Buffer thickness which leads to an increase in the gate effect on the substrate. The source resistance value is influenced by the DIBL( Drain-induced barrier lowering) effect where the rate of decreasing the source resistance will be decreasing consequently to increase the drain bias. The reduction of the source resistance induces the increasing of device sensibility for lows values of current. This the first study that reports on reducing the source resistance related to the gate effect which lead to ensure the possibility of using this device in the field of bio-engineering in where these remarkable results will be added to the high frequency of HEMT.",

For cutting plates out of stainless steel with a thickness of 10 mm an increase of the cutting speed by 60% was achieved compared to conventional processes at unchanged cut edge quality. The great importance of laser machining processes and the need of further improvement of these applications has been considered through development of the presented highly dynamic focus shifting module.",

The microstructure, microhardness and weld bead profile of stainless steel 1.4418 welded were investigated using HLAW, LBW and TIG in the same setting. The influence of heat input on weld pool geometry was surveyed. The results showed that penetration of HLAW doubles that of TIG and were five times that of LBW. Also the grain size in the heat affected zone (HAZ) in TIG was obviously coarse. In the fusion zone, the coaxial grains exist, which the size was the smallest in LBW and was the largest by TIG.",

It is shown that if a Boolean clone is finitely definable (determined by a finite set of relations), then, with 19 exceptions, both min and max elements of this interval are also finitely definable. In case, when a clone on a finite set is not finitely definable, then both endpoints of the associated interval are also not finitely definable partial clones.

A laser direct writing system was used to fabricate microtexture/nanotexture on Ni-Co coating surface, and then the samples were magnetized by a permanent magnet. The tribological properties of the coating were characterised and showed that the magnetic field can significantly reduce the friction forces of Ni-Co coating surface. After magnetizing treatment in a magnetic field, the laser processed coating surface has a much lower friction force than the coating without laser processing; therefore, both laser processing parameters and magnetic flux density could influence the tribological properties of Ni-Co coating surface.",

The measurement is carried out in the narrow space inside the deep hole, and the surface point clouds of different positions are obtained and spliced into a unified coordinate frame. In a single perspective, dozens of laser light planes are projected on the deep hole inner surface, the camera captures the image of the laser light stripes on the inner surface, the 3-D point cloud of the inner surface is solved by the parameters of the camera and the projected light planes. The point cloud acquirement system is driven by the stepping motor to scan the entire surface inside the deep hole, a coordinate transformation model is proposed to provide a rough position of each single-view point cloud, and the point cloud registration algorithm is used to optimize the reconstruction result. A calibration experiment is carried out to obtain the system parameters required for 3-D reconstruction, and the measurement experiments indicate that the rotation reconstruction method is applicable in inner surface measurement and inspection.",

Three test points were preset along one axial line along the parabolic nozzle. Test results agree well with trends obtained by numerical calculation. The peak value of the calculation was higher than that of the experiment at each tested orifice because of the limitation of the numerical models. Multi-pulse testing was also done at a frequency of 20 Hz. Most characteristics of the pressure curves of all the pulses were the same as those obtained in the single pulse test. The start time varied with the order of the pulses. The results of this study are valuable for analysing energy deposition in laser propulsion and modifying numerical models.",

    "abstract": "Microscale laser dynamic flexible forming (μLDFF) is a new kind of high velocity forming (HVF) process. After the laser beam irradiates an ablative medium the rubber obtains shockwave energy to load the sample into the microdie so that the inner surfaces of sample contact with the rubber, while the outer surfaces of sample contact with the microdie. For the outer surfaces of sample, the outer wall surface slide contact with the microdie, while the outer bottom surface impacts with the microdie. This work investigates the different surface morphologies of the different forming regions under different laser energies. The roughening phenomenon was observed on the inner wall surface, and this is because that the rubber does not keep in contact with the sample during forming. When laser energy ranges from 450 to 1550 mJ, increasing laser energy can improve forming accuracy. When laser energy is 1800 mJ, partial fracture occurred at the entrance of the microdie, and oxidation layer was formed on the outer wall surface due to the high speed sliding friction. When laser energy is 1900 mJ, complete fracture occurred at the entrance of the microdie. This work also investigates the mechanical properties of the sample. The results of nanoindentation tests show that the values of nanohardness and elastic modulus in forming regions were obviously increased.",

    "abstract": "Natural oil, gas and coal reserves are limited in nature to which human access has become a major hurdle due to concrete reservoir rocks. Lasers have long been viewed as the ultimate holy-grail to drill through the solid rocks where conventional oil and gas bits fail to spall or grind the hard stones. Oil and gas industry has developed two and three cone diamond and turbo bits to spall and shear rocks to drill boreholes for oil, gas, geothermal and underground coal gasification projects but conventional methods often prove uneconomic and failure inflicting monetary and resource losses. This paper reviews the applications of laser technology in welding, drilling and spallation. Laser technology has also potential for igniting combustible fuel mixtures, wherein 60 to 70% developed fuels are wasted due to incomplete combustion. Global reserves can increase by increasing engine efficiency through complete combustion. Lasers have potential to help break solid rocks in borehole, improve fuels ignition and cause nuclear fusion to produce electricity. This paper also reviews several studies undertaken to measure Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE) of combustible fuels to develop suitable laser ignition system to replace conventional electric spark plugs. Laser spark plugs are expected to appear in market within next few years and laser fusion power plants after a few decades. This work reviews some earlier experimental results and reports some new initiatives to describe role of lasers in energy industry.",

    "abstract": "A generic, low-cost and fully automated roadkill prevention system (RPS) using lasers was developed. The RPS is designed as a real-time system that adapts to all weather conditions, that can detect and categorize road crossing animals based on their heights and display distinguishable (category based) warning light signals for approaching vehicles. The system can also send animal category-specific short message service (SMS) to preserved mobile numbers for detection data base (DDB) generation and take necessary counteraction by the forest officials. The RPS prototype was installed in Velamundi Reserve Forest in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve on the Sathyamangalam – Mettupalayam state highway in 2019 and its performance has been closely monitored since then. At present, the RPS is the only functioning system of its kind in India or elsewhere and has registered a 60% dip in roadkill at the project site since its installation. The complete details like architecture, operational algorithm, implementation and performance analysis of the RPS system over a year is presented. Once available in the literature with complete details, the RPS is expected to be replicated in other parts of the world, wherever roadkill is a growing threat to the existing biodiversity.",

Then, the reciprocating wear tests were carried out under boundary lubrication. The wear resistance of the slideway with biomimetic surface characteristics was greatly improved in comparison with the as-received slideway.

The fuzzy sets principle can be used to transform the original continuous data into categories. Fuzzy coding system is used for the transforming. Then, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is proposed to investigate a table where the data are obtained from fuzzy coding. This process is applied for the data collected in many disciplines like biology, ecology, and so on. The aim of this study is to research how the integration of fuzzy coding system and MCA is applied to continuous meteorological data. The triangular membership function is used for transforming the data with this purpose in this application. According to the results, fuzzy coding is more preferable for transforming continuous meteorological data into categories because fuzzy coding explains nonlinear relationships better than linear relationships.",

In order to verify the FEM model, benchmark simulations are performed and verified with available experimental results. Results show that predicted residual stresses agree well with the experimental data. A key point of interest is that welding tensile residual stress can be modified and changed into compressive residual stress due to laser shock processing. Plastic damage results reveal that void volume fraction (VVF) referring to ductile damage of materials is approximately constant and decays sharply at the edge of the processed region at the surface. The magnitude of surface VVF in the base metal and the welded joint all increase with increasing shock pressure, pressure pulse duration and shot number, however, it almost stays the same at the centre of the impact zone for different spot sizes. A point should be noted that surface VVF in the welded joint is slightly larger than that in the base metal.",

The main aim of this technique is the extraction of the topography and the shape of articles by networks. Based on laser stripe projection, the topography is obtained automatically using Bezier approximation networks. Using the topographic dimension, a two-dimensional Bezier approximation network is able to calculate the shape of an object. The topography is detected by scanning the object by the laser stripe. The scanning produces a set of images of the laser stripe, which are processed by Bezier approximation networks to determine the object dimensions. The Bezier approximation network calculates the dimensions according to the behaviour of the laser stripe. Based on these dimensional data, the Bezier network produces an object model. This model is a replica of the object shape. The idea behind the Bezier approximation networks is to obtain the shape of an object without any measurements being carried out on the optical setup. Thus, the performance of the experimental setup and the accuracy of the results are improved. This is due to the fact that errors of measurement are not passed on to the computational model. The accuracy is assessed by taking the root mean square of the error and data produced by Bezier approximation networks and the data obtained by a contact method. This technique is tested with real objects and the experimental results are presented and assessed.",

To obtain high quality steel-Al joints, three laser welding modes were used to perform lap joint experiments on two metals: DP780 dual phase steel; and 5083 Al alloy. The macroscopic morphology, microstructure and mechanical properties of the DP780 dual phase steel-5083 Al alloy joints formed with these different laser welding modes were investigated. The results show that laser oscillation welding can effectively improve the formation of the weld and reduce cracks, spatter and other defects. Laser oscillation welding through the stirring of the molten pool can distribute heat uniformly throughout the molten pool, reduce the content of ferrite in the welded joint and promote the mixing of liquid DP780 dual phase steel and 5083 Al alloy, effectively reducing the generation of an Al-rich intermetallic compound (IMC). After laser pendulum welding the microhardness of the DP780 dual phase steelside joint was increased significantly by a factor of more than 1½ times over that of the base material (BM). The maximum shear strength of the joint reached 114 N/mm, an increase of 56% compared to that achieved with conventional laser welding.",

The overall growth of 300 nm and uni-dimensional growth of 500 nm along the [001] C-axis of hexagonal ZnO structures are confirmed by SEM and AFM nanoscope studies of solid-state shock wave sintering of ZnO by 300 µs pulses of the diode laser. On the other hand, solid state sintering of spin coated ZnO nanoparticles (24–71 nm initial size) by a 10 ns pulsed Nd:YAG laser ablation in air generates massive growth of 5 micrometre bulbs resembling the growth of cactus plants. However, at a higher laser fluence ‘vapour-liquid-solid’ phase condensation by rapid cooling results in an evolution of nanostructures – tetrapods, nanospheres, nanorods, nanowire and their interconnections.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of Object Based Image Retrieval (OBIR) where the goal is to search for the images containing the same object shown in the query image. The state-of-the-art approaches of large scale OBIR are based on the bag of visual words model. In the bag of visual words model, k-means clustering is performed on the space of feature descriptors to build a visual vocabulary for vector quantization, thereby we can get an inverted file indexing for fast retrieval. However, traditional k-means clustering is difficult to scale to large vocabularies. Although the approximate k-means clustering algorithm and the product quantization(PQ) are proposed to address this problem, the information loss in these methods decreases the performance of OBIR. To reduce information loss, we propose a novel approach to build multiple visual dictionaries indexing for large scale OBIR in this paper. Differing from existing methods, the proposed approach includes three novel contributions. Firstly, we use multiple visual vocabularies built in multiple sub-spaces for vector quantization instead of a single visual vocabulary. Secondly, visual dictionary indexing is proposed, which is more discriminative than inverted file indexing. Thirdly, except for the TF-IDF weighting scheme, a new weighting scheme is introduced to compute the final scores of the relevance of an image to the query more accurately. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on public image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate very significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.",

Laser power, scanning speed, powder feeding voltage, clad layer width, clad layer height, meltpool depth, the ratio of width to height and the dilution rate were established by response surface methodology (RSM) though a central composite design (CCD). The correctness of the mathematical model was verified by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and test index. The results show that the width of the laser clad layer is negatively correlated with the scanning speed, and the influence of laser power and powder feeding voltage is not significant. The height of the laser clad layer is positively correlated with the powder feeding voltage and negatively correlated with the scanning speed, and the laser power has no significant effect on it. The depth of the meltpool is positively correlated with laser power and negatively correlated with scanning speed and powder feeding voltage. The aspect ratio and dilution rate are positively correlated with the laser power and scanning speed, and negatively correlated with the powder feeding voltage, and the influence of the powder feeding voltage on them is the most significant. The process parameters were optimized with the fixed range of aspect ratio and the minimum dilution rate as the objectives. Through experiments, the average errors of predicted and actual value of aspect ratio and dilution rate are 8.1 and 11.1%, respectively. The research results provide a theoretical basis for the morphology control of single laser clad coating and the optimization of process parameters.",

The influence of cover plate material and its thickness on the maximum stress in PMMA substrate was investigated. According to the numerical simulation results, 0.4 mm thick PP cover plate can be thermally bonded to the PMMA substrate with minimum stress and unbounded area.

When the powder feeding rate was 15 g/min, the powder had a good aggregation property. When the rate of powder feeding exceeded 15 g/ min, the spot diameter increased. The experiment of powder convergence and laser cladding forming was carried out by using four-channel coaxial powder feeding nozzles. It was found that the best forming effect is achieved when the powder feeding rate was 15 g/min, which was consistent with simulation results and had a high reference significance for optimization of process parameters of the coaxial nozzle.",

The study believes that reasonable matching can enhance the interdependence of knowledge and organization formed between partners, which in turn affects the synergy of cooperation.

Through screening, 74 sample data with equal organization reputation, organization scale, and scientific research and technical capabilities are obtained, and a hierarchical regression model of equivalent matching factors is constructed. The research results show that the relationship between organizational synergy and synergistic effect can be positively adjusted when the organizational reputation and organizational scale are relatively equal, and the relationship between knowledge synergy and synergistic effect can be positively adjusted when the scientific research capability and technical capability are relatively equal. The research results not only help deepen the existing research results of university-industry cooperation but also enrich the domestic management theory of synergistic innovation. At the same time, it has provided practical guidance for Chinese university-industry strategic alliance, especially in “open innovation” and “network cooperation”.",

With laser focus position in the middle position and the junction position, a small downward bending deformation can be generated which can ensure the forming accuracy.

A model is developed to describe the HRS response of a suspension of molecular aggregates. For pure methanol solutions of the probe molecule where the solute is well dispersed in the liquid phase, the data are in agreement with the expected response for a pure dipolar compound. In particular, the harmonic light scattered by the solution is adequately described by a simple model where the DiA molecules behave as well dispersed point-like dipoles locally excited by the fundamental field and radiating at the harmonic frequency. However, in a water –methanol solvent mixture, the data clearly indicate that the DiA molecules are no longer well dispersed but rather form molecular aggregates. The quadrupolar contribution to the HRS intensity of the molecular aggregate is observed through the emergence of a four lobe pattern in the polar plot of the HRS intensity as a function of the polarization angle of the incoming fundamental wave. The loss of the dipolar two lobe pattern and the rise of a four lobe pattern is attributed to the change of the molecular aggregate structure from a non centrosymetrical to a centrosymmetrical one. These results clearly underline that polarization resolved HRS can be used as a probe tool of the molecular organization in nano-sized aggregates.",

Trivium, one of the eSTREAM project finalists, was designed to be used in hardware-constrained devices. The use of shift registers in the cipher made it susceptible to cryptanalytic attacks. In recent years, Cellular Automata (CA) have evolved as a good cryptographic primitive in the design of stream ciphers. CA are also considered as a good alternative for shift registers in the design of stream ciphers. This paper proposes a new Trivium-like stream cipher called Pentavium which uses 5- neighbourhood CA instead of shift registers of Trivium. The new cipher has a very fast initialization phase when compared to Trivium since it reduces the number of initialization cycles from 1152 to 32 without any compromise to the cryptographic properties of the cipher. The use of higher radii CA in the design makes it resistant to the attacks that were prevalent on reduced rounds of Trivium. The paper also discusses the hardware implementation of the cipher and compares it with Trivium and its variant CAvium.",

One area of limited understanding is that of the variation in bend angle per pass observed during multi-pass laser forming along a single irradiation track, notably the decrease in bend angle per pass after many irradiations.

Nevertheless, there are quite a few research results about SNPS with learning ability applied for image recognition. In this research, the routing mechanism in capsule neural network is introduced into SNPS to update the weights between synapses of spiking neurons dynamically. The learning ability of SNPS is realized by the weight update algorithm, which represents the changes in the strength of neuronal synaptic connections. Moreover, this is the first attempt to construct a novel universal network model of SNPS with learning ability which extracts features though the image convolution. The experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database, namely MNIST, reaches 95.87% and the recognition accuracy of English letters with noise and rotation reaches 98.06% in SNPS, which verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model we constructed.",

In this paper, a granulation-interpolation (GrIp) computing approach which constructs a population of fuzzy sets is proposed in an attempt to address these issues. Granulation is a function for producing a collection of support intervals of fuzzy sets, and the representative data points or knots are determined in these intervals. Interpolation, a curve fitting technique, elicits the membership functions crossing these knots within the support intervals. The numerical results show how different parameters form different distribution patterns in the fuzzy sets collections. Different patterns can satisfy different requirements in the applications. The advantage of this new model is the small number of parameters required for two straightforward algorithms to efficiently construct a series of ordinal fuzzy sets for a linguistic variable. A particular application shows the usability and flexibility, where the patterns of the distribution are describable and scalable by only a few parameters. The proposed model is an ideal tool for specialists to develop a class of fuzzy sets from the group view rather than the classical approaches from the individual view.",

The expression for the Kerr effect induced drift under a laser diode’s accompanying intensity modulation caused by the resonance frequency drift of the fibre ring resonator (FRR) is provided. It is found that the resonance frequency fluctuation induced accompanying intensity modulation would cause a Kerr effect induced drift, which increases as the resonance frequency drift or the laser diode’s frequency-intensity conversion coefficient increases and could be as large as about 1.1 deg/h for an R-FOG with a 12.00 m fibre length fibre ring resonator. Numerical investigation shows that there exist the optimum modulation frequencies for suppressing this drift. But even if the modulation frequencies are optimized, this drift still could not be totally eliminated due to the fluctuations of the intensity coefficient and phase modulation index in the practical situation, and numerical simulation results show that the fluctuations for intensity coefficient and phase modulation index should be controlled to be less than about 0.5 and 0.7%, respectively for keeping the Kerr-induced drift to be less than 1.0 deg/h.",

In conventional CBIR systems, the users are restricted to make a binary labeling on the retrieval results, while this determination is difficult for rich images in semantic. In view of this, a fuzzy relevance feedback approach which enables the user to make a fuzzy judgment is proposed. In the proposed system, namely Semantic Image Retrieval based on Fuzzy Transaction Repository, we accumulate user interactions using a soft feedback model to construct Fuzzy Transaction Repository (FTR). The repository remembers the user’s intent and, therefore, in terms of the semantic meanings, provides a better representation of each image in the database. To best exploit the benefits of user feedback, we improved the proposed system, so that the repository remembers the user’s intent in a suitable manner (as structure-based Fuzzy Transaction Repository) and provides an accurate representation for each image in the database. The semantic similarity between the query and each database image can then be computed using the current feedback and the semantic values in the structure-based FTR. Furthermore, feature re-weighting is applied to the session-term feedback in order to learn the weight of low-level features. These two similarity measures are normalized and combined together to form the overall similarity measure. Our experimental results show that the average precision of the proposed systems exceeds 83% after three iterations. Furthermore, in the long term, the average retrieval accuracy of the improved system surpasses the first.",

In this model, properties of quantum bits are exploited in order to implement Quantum Finite State Machines without an explicit external memory. We show that because of the the natural ability of quantum systems to retain the quantum state, quantum circuits can be directly used to implement some classes of the quantum finite state machines. In particular, the circuit model allows to remove the logic-memory distinction as it is used in the classically established model of finite state machines. Rather, the quantum register implementing the QFSM as a circuit is alternatively used as memory and as logic. In order to allow such behavior the quantum circuit (processor) is controlled by a classical circuit that provides the necessary timing of the quantum operations as well as the interface between the quantum and the classical world. Moreover, additional mechanism for preserving unknown quantum qubit state is used and a novel computational protocol allowing the implementation of the QFSM is proposed. This framework is is called the Classically Controlled Quantum Computer (CCQC). The CCQC thus combines a quantum processor with a classical controller in such manner that computation is carried from the classical inputs, through quantum processing to classical outputs.",

The lasing wavelengths are determined by discrete fiber Bragg gratings in the laser cavity and can be tuned by compressing or extending the gratings. To ensure that the wavelength tuning with equal wavelength spacing, the discrete gratings are mounted onto an organic plastic plate with angles between adjacent gratings such that the tuning forces applied to the gratings experience equal increments in force. Time delays, with equal increasing or decreasing time delay differences for equally spaced wavelengths are achieved if the modulated lightwaves are reflected at different locations of a linearly chirped grating in the time-delay network. A four-channel chirped-grating-based continuously tunable differential true-time-delay gradient system suitable for continuous beam steering at microwave frequencies up to 10 GHz has been constructed and will be demonstrated.",

The electronic properties were calculated for the molecules with geometries optimized in gas-phase as well as affected by polymeric environment. The time dependent functional density theory and time dependent Hartree-Fock formalism were used for the quantum chemical calculations for SiC and imidazoles, respectively. For the SiC/ PMMA composite the hierarchical approach was applied involving the use of molecular dynamics and then quantum chemical calculations methodology. For the organic chromophores the C-PCM model was tested. The solvent effect on the geometry of chromophores is more pronounced for the inorganic nanograins than for organic molecules but in both cases it should be taken into account specially supporting the nonlinear optical properties calculations.",

    "abstract": "It is known that underwater image formation is affected not only by absorption and scattering properties of water, but also the optical systems including lenses and sensors. Applications such as image enhancement and restoration can effectively remove the blur and degradation, but the resolution is still limited. Image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) techniques such as iterative back projection (IBP) method are promising approaches for improving resolution beyond the limit of hardware. With knowledge of the point spread function (PSF), the performance of the super-resolution reconstruction can be further enhanced, which will be beneficial to various underwater imaging or detecting applications. The presented effort applies several PSF models including a simplified model based on beam transmission considering time-related backscattering as well as an imagery-derived approach based on measurement to the IBP method for underwater range-gated imaging, blind and objective image quality metrics are used for evaluation, experimental results of which show adequate improvement and flexibility provided by the proposed approaches.",

The critical conditions for the onset of drop breakup, as well as the modes of breakup, are examined. The experiments are performed for different surfactant concentrations in order to identify the effect of surfactants on the breakup mechanisms identified earlier for surfactant-free systems. These mechanisms include transient stretching, propagation of capillary waves along the interface, formation of a re-entrant cavity at the trailing end of the drop that evolves into a jet of suspending fluid penetrating the drop, and tail-streaming wherein the drop develops a pointed tail which emits a stream of very small droplets. In most cases, the presence of surfactant is found to accelerate the onset of drop breakup. Namely, surfactant-bearing drops are found to break up at smaller critical capillary numbers compared to their surfactant-free counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Realistic simulations of pedestrian dynamics are an important tool to assess critical evacuation scenarios during the process of an event’s management. However, for practicability reasons, the software has to run on available computers faster than real time. Cellular automata models are compared to space-continuous models very fast and hence are a good candidate for this use case. However, due to its limited geometry resolution, they have well-known problems with treating corners and turns. This present paper shows how a standard CA model can be modified to produce a realistic movement of people around bends and obstacles by changing the standard floor field, using simple predictions for the immediate future. By adaptively allowing for the temporary situation using simple predictions for the immediate future. The approach has two tuning parameters that have a distinct meaning and can, therefore, be set correctly. A further application of the proposed method is the automatic generation of guiding lines for any space-continuous model.",

SmFe2 and a small amount of Sm2Fe17 as well as Fe were formed from unidirectional solidification in μg of Sm-7Fe alloy, obtained using the drop tower and parabolic flight. The structure consisted of sheet dendrites of SmFe2 and Fe-rich Sm-Fe layers between the sheet dendrites having no gaps with an orientation along the solidification direction. The surface of the sheet dendrites of SmFe2 formed in μg obtained by parabolic flight was rougher than that formed in μg obtained using the 10-m drop tower. A crystalline orientation of of SmFe2 along the solidification direction was found in the products formed in μg using the drop tower, but not in those using parabolic flight. The formation mechanisms of SmFe2 sheet dendrites can be explained by microsegregation caused by the lack of convection in melt in μg. In contrast, Sm2Fe17 and a small amount of Fe were formed from unidirectional solidification of Sm-7Fe alloy in 1g, and the resulting structure consisted of sheet dendrites with no orientation. Magnetostriction of -3328 ppm at the outer magnetic fields of 0.12 T was achieved on a sample synthesized by unidirectional solidification of Sm-7Fe in ±4 × 10-3 g obtained using the drop tower. The value was higher than that synthesized in fluctuating gravity between 0.1 and -0.02 g obtained by parabolic flight, -1776 ppm, because of the crystallographic orientation and the lack of a rough surface of the SmFe2 sheet dendrites.",

A second order accurate scheme based on the finite volume method and domain decomposition of the structural grid was used to compute the drag performance of cylinders in a hypersonic flow of Mach 6.5 at an altitude of 30 km with high-repetition rate energy depositions. The effects of Mach number on drag reduction were also studied. The results showed that the bow shock was changed into oblique shock from the interaction between the laser-induced blast wave and the bow shock over the blunt body. Also, the front-surface pressure was decreased. When the distance between the energy deposition location and the vehicle head was equal to the vehicle radius, the wave drag was reduced to 28.7% of the basic drag (without laser beam interaction), and the power effectiveness was 13.5 at Mach 6.5. The basic drag increased with increasing Mach number. At Mach 10 the power effectiveness was as high as 41.6, but the normalized drag was relatively low. Unfortunately the surface temperature of blunt body was increased due to the laser beam interaction.",

Most decision-making problems deal with uncertain and imprecise data so conventional approaches cannot be effective to find the best solution. To cope with this uncertainty, fuzzy set theory has been developed as an effective mathematical algebra under vague environment. When the system involves human subjectivity, fuzzy algebra provides a mathematical framework for integrating imprecision and vagueness into the decision making models. Owing to the subjective and incomplete data, preference of alternatives is modeled with fuzzy preference relation. Three preference models are used to evaluate the nondominance set from a set of alternatives. The application of this technique draws from a real world case study concerning the location decision of a combined automotive manufacturing and distribution (warehousing) facility in Turkey. Fuzzy outranking approach is used to determine the best location between four alternatives. Consequently, location 4 is the best decision for automotive company (plant and warehousing).",

Spectral techniques also have potential application for reversible and quantum circuits. This paper addresses the classification of 3-valued functions into spectral translation equivalence classes. A transform algorithm is presented that determines the spectral translations to map a given function to the representative function for the equivalence class containing the given function. Using this algorithm we show, by exhaustive enumeration, that the 2-variable 3-valued functions partition into 11 equivalence classes. The number of 3-valued functions with 3 or more variables is very large, prohibiting exhaustive enumeration. We show that a search of 3-valued function 1-neighbourhoods yields 167,266 equivalence classes for 3 variables. The transform algorithm can be used for a higher number of variables to determine if two functions fall within the same equivalence class and, if they do, to find a sequence of spectral translations to map one to the other.",

However, few decades ago the idea of machines with intelligence was also ridiculed, but today not only we have developed intelligent machines, but we are also exploring many areas for their application with great success.We have always overlooked the emotional factors during machine learning and decision making; however, it is quite conceivable to artificially model some emotions in machine learning. This paper presents four emotional neural network models (EmNNs) that are based on the emotional back propagation (EmBP) learning algorithm. The EmNNs have emotional weights and two emotional parameters; anxiety and confidence, which are updated during learning. The four EmNN models differ in their topologies as a result of different input data coding methods. The performance of the EmNN models when applied to a blood cell type identification problem will be evaluated. Experimental results show that the additional emotional parameters and weights in all four models improve the identification rate as well as the classification time.",

A few commercial SLM systems have started to process a select choice of aluminium alloys. These alloys are generally based on conventional casting alloys that do not represent the highest performance aluminium alloys for aerospace application. This paper studies the consolidation behaviour and resulting microstructure of pure aluminium, 6061 alloy powder and a mixture of 6061 alloy powder with copper powder under different SLM processing parameters. It has found that the addition of copper powder to 6061 Al powder considerably changes the consolidation behaviour and microstructural characteristics, resulting in a denser and much finer microstructure. This work therefore demonstrates the premise to develop specific aluminium alloy powders for the SLM process and enabling the fabrication of high performance aluminium based products.",

These patterns provide a simple but powerful spatial description of eye texture, and put up great robustness in different lighting, noise, and low cost of calculation. The working principle of ARLBP is described in detail, and a system is designed for precise eye location. The eye location system is composed of three parts. The pure facial region is detected and cut firstly. Then, the ARLBP features of the face is obtained based on grayscale analysis, and candidate eye regions are given through the eye filter based on texture information by projection method. Finally, the precise eye center locating method is described using boundary tracking and centroid method. The system is tested based on the standard distance measure, and the experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement using the proposed method over others on four headand- shoulder databases.",

The thin sheets of the Ti6Al4V have been joined in butt joint alignment using a millisecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The microstructural behavior and quality of weld bead have been characterized under optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Radiographic inspection has also been made to check the internal flaws and material distribution in the welded joints. The study indicates that the weldments are free from cracks and possess high concentration of material in the welded region. The mechanical behavior of the welded joints has been examined for microhardness, residual stress and tensile strength. Finally, a surface morphological study of fractured surface obtained from tensile test has been analysed. The analysis indicates that the fracture is ductile in nature. The surface having a greater number of dimples exhibits high welding strength as compared to samples having a smaller number of dimples. An empirical equation relating welding strength with process parameters has been developed through non-linear multiple regression analysis. Since welding strengths predicted from the empirical model are in good agreement with the experimental results, the model is said to be valid and adequate for further use.",

Fuzzy sets have been used to model the uncertain processing times and due dates in recent years. In this study, a fuzzy job shop scheduling problem with availability constraints is considered. Availability constraints mean that machines can be unavailable for preventive maintenance, periodic repair or random breakdown. These constraints have been considered in this study for fuzzy job shop scheduling problems. A Scatter Search (SS) method is proposed to solve these problems. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scatter search method is demonstrated by comparing it with the hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA).

Controlling of temperature rise due to the presence of nanoparticle in the tumour site is obligatory because it can be harmful for normal tissues. So, the tumour boundary temperature must be controlled. The designed control mechanism was based on a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller. Coefficients of the PID controller were estimated through an optimization algorithm called imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). Difference between the desired temperature of the tumour mass and its actual temperature in each instance was the controller input; in contrast, the controller output was the laser power adjustment in each instance. The simulation studies were carried out on a physiological model of virtual tissue containing the tumour mass, healthy tissue and nanoparticles (NP). In the first step, optimal size of the used nanoparticles (GaAs/AlGaAs) was computed to guarantee radiation of wavelengths near the infrared (IR) wavelengths when being exposed to the laser radiation with wavelengths of 680 to 720 nm. The Schrödinger equations and effective mass equation were solved to obtain optimal size of the nanoparticles. In the next step, performance of the presented closed-loop controller was evaluated using simulation studies on the model of virtual tissue. The results showed desirable control of heat variations generated by quantum-dots (QD) during the heat therapy. Desirable optical-thermal responses of the laser-radiated tissue certified attractive performance of the proposed control methodology.",

There areWiFi access points in most buildings and measuring WiFi signal is free of charge even for private WiFi networks. Unfortunately, it also has some disadvantages: when extending WiFi-based localization systems to large environments their accuracy decreases. This has been previously solved by manually dividing the environment into zones. In this paper, an automatic partition of the environment is proposed to increase the localization accuracy in large environments. To do so, a hierarchical partition of the environment is performed using K-Means and the Calinski-Harabasz Index. Then, different classification techniques have been compared to achieve high localization rates. The new approach is tested in a real environment with more than 200 access points and 133 topological positions, obtaining an overall increase in the accuracy of approximately 10% and reducing the mean error to 2.45 metres.",

The expression for the demodulation curve under intensity modulation caused by the dynamic input rotation angular rate and varied environmental factors induced resonance frequency drift is provided. Numerical investigation shows that under the intensity modulation effect due to dynamic input rotation angular rate, which results in a bending trend for the linear part of demodulation curve, the linearity of R-FOG system is deteriorated, and the scale factor nonlinearity of gyro output increases as the frequency-intensity conversion coefficient of the LD increases. By simulating the demodulation curve with different amount of resonance frequency drift due to varied environmental factors, the slope of the linear part is found to fluctuate under the resonance frequency drift induced intensity modulation, and it causes the scale factor of the practical R-FOG system to fluctuates. This scale factor fluctuation results in a system measurement error, which is proven to increase as the amount of resonance frequency drift or input rotation angular rate increases, and numerical calculation result shows this large system error should be counted for an open-loop R-FOG system.",

    "abstract": "The use of laser energy to ignite gas and liquid based fuel-air mixtures has been the subject of a number of studies and laboratory experiments at a fundamental level over the past 30 years. Yet, the practical implementation of this laser application has still to be fully realised in a commercial automotive application. Laser Ignition (LI), as a replacement for Spark Ignition (SI) in the internal combustion (IC) engines of automotive vehicles, offers several potential advantages including extending lean burn capability, reducing the cyclic variants between combustion cycles and reducing the overall ignition package costs, weight and energy requirements. The continued development of increasingly compact and efficient laser sources and new associated laser beam delivery techniques have provided the basis for significant steps forward in research towards practical proof-of-concept demonstration of LI in engines for automotive vehicles. This paper reports on some results of research recently undertaken in the Department of Engineering, University of Liverpool, in which a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm wavelength has been used to successfully ignite and run (for extended periods) one cylinder of a 4-cylinder internal combustion (IC) test engine. The variation of several laser parameters and their effect on the engine performance are reported; namely, pulse energies of 5–20 mJ, pulse lengths of 6–15 ns and focused beam waist diameters at the combustion point of 40–100•m. The engine performance was measured in terms of changes in Coefficient of Variant (COV) in both Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and the Peak Cylinder Pressure Position (PPP). Further experiments on the focal position of laser ignition were undertaken.",

First results for surface tension of liquid nickel from our working group by Aziz et al. [1], which led to the first publication on the topic of our Electromagnetic Levitation (EML) setup, delivered unusual high values compared to the literature, which itself covers a wide range. To find the reason for this behaviour the aim of this work was to investigate the surface tension of nickel samples from different suppliers at similar purity grades by the Oscillating Drop (OD) technique using the EML setup of the Thermophysics and Metalphysics Group at Graz University of Technology. Since no significant deviations between samples from different suppliers have been found, an extensive literature research according to various experimental and evaluation parameters has been performed. In the course of this investigation, the earlier obtained experimental data of Aziz et al. were re-evaluated. Due to gained awareness in evaluating the translational frequency in vertical direction, the mystery of these elevated surface tension results could be solved, so that in the end the originally obtained results of Aziz have been drastically decreased through re-evaluation.",

The method is based on measuring the frequency of impulse induced longitudinal vibration of a tungsten filament, subject to joule heating. The natural resonance frequency of the filament is obtained by lock-in synchronous photo-detection of the laser-generated filament shadowgraph. The correlation between the filament natural frequency and its temperature lead to the calculation of shear modulus at variable temperatures, the tensile and bulk moduli of tungsten. The results were compared to those obtained by laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) of a tungsten wire induced by pulsed current technique. Our method permitted a wider measuring temperature range and an easier calculation procedure. The used setup was simple, non-destructive, non-contacting and accurate, enabling low-cost vibrometry measurements that help in future synthesis and test of new grades of refractory materials, deployed as plasma-facing material in the latest fusion reactor or super alloys in critical applications.",

Numerous experiments are carried out to overcome these limitations and enhance physical properties by analyzing and controlling additive alignment. To achieve enhancement, it is important to understand the rheology of the additive in a polymer matrix and the resulting alignments inside the mold during the molding process. In this study, a flow visualization experiment was carried out to simulate an injection molding process of polymer composites with carbon fiber as an additive. The alignment of carbon fiber is analyzed as it travels through the gate orifice of the mold channel. An experimental device consisting of a ball-milled-carbon-fiber and Polydimethylsiloxane mixture, syringe pump and tubing, high speed camera with microscope, and lighting system is set up to visualize the additive alignment and orientation inside the mold channel. Two configurations of the gate orifice are used as mold channels. The location, length, and angle of additives were calculated by analyzing images acquired through flow visualization experiments. The orientation of fibers is observed to be determined by the relative amplitudes of velocity gradient components. In addition, it was observed that the position of the gate affects the average angle of the additives in the mold channel.",

With this geometry, only in plane anisotropy or poling can be observed. A 3D experimental arrangement is described, in which molecules may be optically pumped in two orthogonal directions and probed in three directions. The method of measurement of the 3D anisotropy is discussed and illustrated by two experiments. In the first AOP and PIA experiment, a MMA-DR1 copolymer film is pumped by two co-propagating linearly polarized coherent harmonic beams and by a third incoherent circularly polarized beam, which reduces anisotropy: the expected improvement of poling was not observed, which should initiate new theoretical works. In the second experiment, the 3D anisotropy of a thin film of evaporated small azoic molecules is studied: before any optical excitation, this film is noncentrosymmetric and very anisotropic. Optical pumping destroys this natural anisotropy and hardly tends to impose its own symmetry.",

The radiation-induced photodiodes defects can modify the initial doping concentrations, creating generation-recombination centres and introducing trapping of signal charge carriers. Additionally, introduction rate of the lattice defects is thermally activated and decreases with increasing irradiation temperature as a result of annealing of the damage. The present work aims at a comparison of the behaviour of differently constructed Si and InGaAs PIN photodiodes after exposure to deferent conditions (ionizing gamma rays doses and electrons particles fluences respectively) of radiation with increasing temperature. Nonlinear relations are correlated to investigate the current-voltage and capacitance-voltage dependences based on the equivalent circuit of the PIN photodiodes where thermal and irradiation effects are considered. Thermal and irradiation effects are modelled and investigated over the practical ranges of interest. Both the ambient temperature and irradiation dose as well as the spectral power of incident light possess several effects on the electro-optical PIN photodiode characteristics (dark current, photocurrent, absorption coefficient, responsivity, quantum efficiency and directivity) and consequently SNR and BER for analog and digital optical link systems.",

The measurement of electrical resistivity as a function of specific enthalpy was combined with specific heat capacity measurements by differential scanning calorimetry to obtain the relation between resistivity and temperature. This is necessary, since a contactless temperature measurement was not possible due to the low sensitivity of our pyrometers of the millisecond pulse-heating system. Additionally to electrical resistivity and specific heat capacity, density at room temperature, thermal diffusivity, and thermal expansion was measured. From these results, thermal conductivity was calculated. Comparing thermal conductivity to electrical resistivity, the Lorenz number can be computed for the entire temperature range.",

The design methodology is presented in three general steps, first we use the principle of justifiable granularity to build a diagram of the justifiable information granule that contains a data structure with the descriptive measures of the experimental evidence of the data set. These measures are obtained from the partition matrix of the utilized clustering process, and these measures are used to evaluate the parameters of the type-2 membership functions and characterize its JFOU. Second, we use the data structure of the justifiable information granule to characterize and parameterize the asymmetric type-2 membership functions of the fuzzy system. Lastly, the main procedure to obtain all the justifiable information fuzzy granules that define the knowledge base and the inference process of the fuzzy model, is presented.

The predictions of the two equations and the Fourier heating models are compared with those for the electron kinetic theory.

In particular we note that the variation in a single droplet’s behavior, analyzed as the stop-go interval, displays a power law distribution indicating bias in behavior. In addition, the rate of movement of the droplet in comparison to the diffusion rate of chemical reaction products in the system may affect the movement of the droplet resulting in long time scale memory effects. These discoveries illustrate that coupling a chemical reaction (hydrolysis of the anhydride) to a physical body (the oil droplet) can result in an instability that affects many aspects of the droplet system, from reaction rate to convective flow patterns to overall shape to macroscopic behavior.",

Nevertheless, a related open question would ask for a definition of the intermediate conservation degree of a rule. Based upon those conditions, a theoretical measure is formulated for the intermediate conservation degree for one-dimensional cellular automata rules, based upon Boccara-Fuks conditions. However, its appropriateness for the target quantity is not verified, according to a corresponding empirical measure that is defined. Two additional empirical measures are then defined, representing alternative interpretations to the quantity. Results of computational experiments are discussed involve all approaches, and possible relations between the theoretical and experimental measures are investigated. The paper advances the conceptual structure of the theme, by suggesting that the theoretical approach is not adequate for the intended objective, at the same time that the latter two empirical alternatives suggest what is really at stake, thus pointing at what their theoretical counterparts should account for.",

The different light sources such as sunlight, UV (λ = 254 nm) and halogen lamp have been used. The size, shape and morphology of the nanocrystals could be tailored by varying the light source and the exposure time. These factors strongly affect the particle shape, their self-assembly into graphene surface and also the growth rate. Remarkable increase in the growth rate even at sunlight occurs upon introducing graphene oxide into the reaction mixture. The role of graphene as a catalyst and strong light absorber leads to increasing the growth rate and enhances the formation of rods, wires and more anisotropic shapes. However, this is controlling the catalytic reduction of gold ions and the diffusion rate of gold seeds into the graphene sheets. These give more complex structure such as snowflake gold nanostructure or self-assembled regular-shaped nanocrystals superlattice could be constructed on the graphene surface.",

This paper proposes an unconventional approach to determine organisationally cohesive subgroups for better job rotation by combining biological computation and fuzzy-based methods to firstly detect all possible employees in cliques and components, secondly find employees in fuzzy cliques, and finally arrange the employees into similar groups.

The findings showed that the effect of laser power parameter was considerable on the cutting edge quality and temperature of cutting region.

A stable room temperature dual-wavelength fibre laser with a power of nearly 10 mW and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 21 dB was obtained. The stable dual-wavelength lasing oscillation had a wavelength spacing of 0.08 nm and could be tuned within a range of approximately 35 nm, from 1530 to 1565 nm.

A one-dimensional (1-D) numerical calculation model is established, which considered phase transition, absorption of laser energy, and dynamic mechanical response. The flyer motion is simulated by using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference method (FDM), level set equation and ghost fluid method. It is found that the double-pulse laser can effectively increase the flyer velocity and energy efficiency. At the end of laser irradiation, the aluminium film exhibits three regions: gas phase, gas-solid mixture phase and solid phase. During the acceleration process, the flyer undergoes intense compression and tension.",

Instead, vibration based methods are touted alongside the use of immersion. This system will be developed using an analytical method: computational fluid dynamics (CFD), to clarify ideas and refine the design though an iterative process.

In order to verify the reliability of the model, experimental tests were carried out to verify the surface quality and tissue morphology of the molten coating under the two scanning methods. The results show that the agreement between the theoretical calculation results and the experimental results is good. In addition, both scanning methods generate pores at the coating laps.

    "abstract": "The application of lasers in materials science and materials processing encompasses a wide range of technologies with the main theme based on the laser beam as a source of heat to modify microstructure and composition for the tailoring of properties or the processing of components. The laser beam offers several advantages over conventional processing routes, like faster processing speed, refinement and homogenization of microstructure, narrow heat affected zone (HAZ), and attainment of metastable microstructures. Clearly, there is immense scope in this field and all of the papers in this special issue represent original developments in laser materials processing and serve to motivate the reader to consider further research problems in this direction. Finally, we wish this special issue to be successful, popular and useful to the engineers, scientists and researchers in the fields of laser materials processing, materials science and engineering, and manufacturing technology.",

In addition, a robust bioelectronic interface served as a key that unlocks strings of digital code; the generated code—based on the control of the oxygen reduction reaction—produced a directly readable barcode.",

Unfortunately, such an observation is not always available in practice. On one hand, in a finite amount of time, an observation is incomplete up to a certain moment, and the future execution is unknown. On the other hand, an observation is possibly inaccurate due to lack of detailed design information of the system under monitoring. In this paper, we investigate a monitoring approach based on linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. We propose a five-valued semantics for LTL to deal with both dimensions of uncertainty. We develop an efficient runtime verification algorithm using formula rewriting, and show the feasibility of our approach with a case study in the railway domain.",

The model incorporates drivers’ individual characteristics and acceleration constraints of vehicles in the definition of lane changing decision process. The aim is to make the lane change process more in line with real features. Thus, the drivers’ representation in the model is more like human response by reconstructing the local behavior on a microscopic level. Simulation results on a system with periodic conditions show that lane usage inversion, lane change rate versus density and different traffic states are reproduced by the model. Besides, in this model the flow is not dominated by the introduction of larger vehicles with smaller maximum velocity, even if their lane change is not prohibited. Moreover, ping-pong lane changes are reduced. The model preserves the computational simplicity of CA models.",

We introduce “spatial attributes” and adapt the definition of the control through the actuator and attribute structures. We have focused on models where the space is heterogeneous and its configuration affects the evolution of the system. Thus, the proposed control operates by modifying the structure of the space to achieve the desired state of the system. The proposed protector control is based on the attributes of an area against a time-distributed disturbance. To illustrate our approach, we consider a CA based on 3D geometric cells providing a robust platform that demonstrates the potential of representing spatial dynamical phenomena in 3D. As a real-world application of the above approach, we consider a forest fire propagation model that we have been developing.",

In order to determine the factor which takes most important position to affect the depth and quality, the welding speed and power were chosen as two factors to devise the LBW orthogonal experiments of two different thickness specimens. The variance of the welding speed and power based on the penetration depth indicate that the power is the more important factor for LBW. In addition, an empirical model was proposed to represent the relationship between heat input and weld bead geometry parameters. The relationship of the heat input, melting efficiency and the penetration depth has been derived. The metallography by comparing with specimens of different groups shows that the heat input affects the microstructure but not so intense as geometric morphology.",

Rising need of image quality enhancement in various fields have led to the development of different kinds of filtering and other techniques. Over the years many linear and nonlinear filters have been developed and applied to the poor quality and distorted images to remove the noise and improve the quality. This paper deals with the restoration of old and almost destroyed art works. Four different types of filters namely Median Filter, Gaussian Filter, Wiener Filter and Average (or Mean) Filter are used for denoising purpose. Later on Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization is also used for further improvement of image quality. Various parameters like AMBE, PSNR, NMSE, CPP and EME have been calculated to measure the performance of the combination of different filters and CLAHE technique. MATLAB software is used for the implementation of the above mentioned analysis.",

Examples of three classes: general, semi-totalistic and totalistic of two-color one dimension range-two automata are analyzed for potential practical use. The problem of desired change in the opacity of the shading array as a function of the sequence of initial conditions (SIC) is discussed. The ideal SICs for selected CAs on 12 × 12 cell arrays found by backtracking algorithm are presented. The influence of the type of boundary conditions (BC) is discussed and a special type of a fixed BC is introduced. The robustness of the system under two types of permanent failure is analyzed – the single cell failure, and deactivation of a single column of cells.",

Laser brazing is a process, which can be used to make such a composite structure possible. The main problem of thermal joining processes is the formation of inter-metallic composite phases, which reduce the performance of the joint. Laser brazing enables localized fusion of a joint with limited precipitation of these brittle phases. This paper presents the results of a feasibility study of two filler metals: AlSi-12 and ZnAl-15. The study shows that the joints brazed using ZnAl-15 have better mechanical properties that those brazed with AlSi-12.",

Results showed that by increasing laser peak power, decreasing pulse duration and increasing laser pulse energy, the weld penetration increases. Metallurgical observations revealed that welded zone comprises of acicular αˊ phase within prior coarse β grains. Microhardness distribution is more uniform in welded zone. The microhardness value in the welded zone is the highest which is attributed to high martensitic phase content in the welded zone.

The results show that the forming quality of weld surface in laser-leading mode is better than that of arc-leading mode, and the weld penetration is obviously deeper than that of arc-leading mode. The weld penetration formation mechanism in two hybrid modes is associated with the hybrid state between the laser plasma and the arc plasma. In laser-leading mode, the root of the arc plasma acts on the laser keyhole and connects with the keyhole plasma, and a hybrid discharge happens. The keyhole part of the hybrid plasma possesses extreme electric conductivity, the arc is strengthened by the laser plasma and the current density and the energy utilization are enhanced as well, so the weld penetration in laser-leading mode hybrid welding is deeper than that of arc-leading mode.",

    "abstract": "For the Bag-of-Words based image retrieval approaches, most of them rely on the local feature. However, the simple SIFT feature has led to false positive matches since the SIFT feature only describes the local gradient distribution. It has been shown that combining multiple complementary features such as shape, color or texture is a challenging and promising task which can improve the retrieval accuracy. However, most of the state-of-the-art feature fusion methods are usually requested to provide some weight assignments for the features, and providing such weight assignments for the features is not always easy without any initial knowledge about the image database. Furthermore obtaining the weight value requires an additional learning stage. In this paper, we present a new feature fusion solution, called SKFF, which takes advantage of the skyline operator to combine the local features and need not to provide weight value for each feature. The new solution incorporates the multiple dimensional feature vector into skyline operator, each dimension corresponds to one kind of feature similarity. The candidate results of our method include not only the images which are more similar to the query image in multiple cues, but also in simple cue. According to detailed analysis, we show that the proposed solution can overcome the deficiencies of simple feature image retrieval. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed solution through extensive experiments on several public image sets. Our experiments show that the proposed mechanism improves the retrieval accuracy significantly compared to existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "In the ongoing world, modern deep learning with computer interface technology has proven superior to previous learning methods. Video surveillance in smart monitoring has been broadly researched because of its wide range of applications. Though there are many significant challenges in successful data frame processing in the spatial and temporal domain, efficient classification of high-dimensional moving and live video frames remains needed research. To overcome such challenging problems, An Integrated Deep Learning-Based Smart Video Monitoring Module (DLS- VMM) for effective indoor stadium surveillance has been suggested. In particular, to analyze frame features, a significant storage network and access network have been introduced. To obtain automated indoor stadium monitoring and surveillance, the DLSVMM is processed to convert high-dimensional features into a class of lower-dimensional features Forgetting the timely frames of videos indoors. Such stored data are trained in the sub-spaces and integrated to encrypt the initial retrieval influenced by error clearance performance using digital communication codes to implement further improvements. The study findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The high efficiency with detailed studies includes implementation and validation experimentally. The results revealed that the accuracy, F-measure, sensitivity, delay, and validation ratio of the DLSVMM achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods.",

The system with feedback loop shows strong rejection to electric circuit noise and laser frequency noise in the system output bandwidth, but nearly no effect on the power of PD noise. For the whole noise power spectrum, larger loop delay and system output bandwidth induces more power for all the three noise sources, and larger loop gain induces less power for both electric circuit and laser frequency noises but more power for PD noise. The sum of the three noises equivalent rotation is predicted and optimized by choosing different loop gain, loop delay and output bandwidth, and it is concluded that for a resonator micro-optic gyroscope (RMOG) with a 7.9 cm perimeter resonator, if the system loop delay decreases to 1 μs and gain increases to 1.6 × 10",

Model reconstruction quality based on point cloud is highly dependent on the validity of the segmentation results. The segmentation is challenging because of the huge amount of points with different local densities, and lack explicit structure, especially in the presence of random noisy points. This paper presents a hierarchical clustering segmentation algorithm using multidimensional characteristics. First, an initial segmentation is established by means of notion of clusters based on point cloud density to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. The points that are relatively far away and dense can be grouped. Second, a building can be extracted from urban point cloud based on its spectral characteristics. Finally, a building can be further subdivided based on a collection of geometrical characteristics of point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only extract building from the surrounding environment but also decompose it into different planes which lay a good foundation for building reconstruction.",

Far-field fluorescence, when excited by polarized evanescent field, revealed that there were many regions in the specimen where molecule’s transition moment oriented parallel to the substrate surface. These two observations suggest that the near-field at the tip of the probe polarized parallel to the probe axis. Another observation that molecules seemed to orient to similar direction among particles within these regions suggests that dewetting process contributes to align molecular direction among neighboring particles, which further justifies that the present specimen was formed by a self-organizing mechanism.",

Along with low power consuming circuits, another factor that draws major attention is the area. The designers are continuously trying to place more and more components on single chip to form compact and portable devices. The proposed full subtractor consumes less area because with GDI technique in use, number of transistor employed is less as compared to conventional subtractor.

Processing parameters are of great importance in achieving the desired properties in LMD process. In this study, the effect of laser power and scanning velocity on the microstructure, the microhardness and the wear resistance properties of Ti6Al4V/TiC composites has been thoroughly investigated in order to optimize these process parameters. The Ti6Al4V/ TiC composites were laser deposited with a composition ratio of 50 wt.% Ti64 and 50 wt.% TiC and at 50% overlap percentage. The laser power was varied from 1.0 to 3.8 kW and the scanning speed was varied between 0.030 and 0.100 m/s. The results shows that the optimum process parameters is at a laser power of about 2.0 kW and the scanning speed is about 0.055 m/s.",

Current explosive shaped charge perforating methods can cause formation damage that results in a reduction of the permeability and necessitates costly post-perforation operations. Fracturing is also the process of initiation and propagation of a crack by pumping fluid at relatively high flow rates to enhance the production of oil and gas wells. This fluid pressure initiates a fracture and extends it into the rock medium. One of the newest technologies recommended as a suitable alternative for conventional perforating methods and fracture initiation is high power laser technology. This paper assesses the efficacy of high power lasers in perforation and fracture initiation of oil and gas wells.",

Schmitt Trigger is used in place conventional NOT gate for improving the performance and output of the circuit. With the use of Schmitt Trigger in place of conventional NOT gate the hysteresis in the circuit is adjusted which leads to reduction of noise, decreasing the slew rate in the output, reduction in leakage power and improving delay in the circuitry. Noise in any circuit can change the output state and distort the information. The proposed design reduces noise and thus enhancing the performance of the circuit. Efficiency in the AND and OR Gate is improved to 34% and 50% from 29.5% and 40% respectively. Presented design shows improvement in leakage power dissipation as compared to conventional AND and OR based logic gate. The operating voltage is very low as compared to other circuits.

Laser radar, as a high-precision detection sensor, has been widely used in vehicle environment perception. However, at present, artificial intelligence vehicles still have great potential safety hazards, causing many traffic accidents. Therefore, it is very important to study the application of laser radar in precise vehicle positioning and obstacle detection. Based on the application of laser radar in vehicles, this paper introduced LOAM algorithm in the research of precise vehicle positioning and recorded and compared the track using a solid vehicle model; in the research of obstacle detection, the clustering algorithm in grid map was introduced, and the radar induction system was built on the computer and simulated with relevant software. This study aims to provide a reference for the application of laser radar in vehicles and offer a theoretical basis for the improvement of the automatic driving vehicle to improve its safety performance. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that the application of radar in precise vehicle positioning and obstacle detection shows good accuracy; thus, this method is feasible. However, the accuracy of laser radar in obstacle detection cannot be guaranteed for objects with continuous motion and a long distance.",

In this work, we portrayed a simple method to avoid the formation of cracks by employing the commonly used adhesive tape. With the protection of adhesive tape, microchannels could be fabricated without any cracks at laser power less than 30%. The effect of laser parameters (laser power, scanning speed, and scanning passes) on the width and depth of the microchannel was investigated. To fully bonded the chip with perm-selective membrane, the influence of bonding pressure on the channel deformation and leakage area was analysed by numerical simulation.

The practical example for temperature formulation is presented for a two layer assembly consisting of steel and nickel. The convection cooling is incorporated in the analysis at the top surface of steel to account for the assisting gas effect during laser heating process. It is found that rate of temperature rise is high in the surface region during the early heating periods because of the internal energy gain from the irradiated field and low rate of heat diffusion from the irradiated region to its neighbourhood. The influence of convection cooling on temperature rise is considerable in the surface region, which is more pronounced at high Biot numbers. Temperature decay inside steel is gradual; however, it becomes sharp in nickel because of the differences in thermal conductivity of nickel and steel.",

While aiming at providing a general international viewpoint on the advancement of molecular nonlinear optics by and large, as well as discuss its current and foreseeable status, the organizers seized the opportunity of the 60th anniversary of Joseph Zyss on that same year to pay tribute to one of the founders of molecular nonlinear optics. The conference was thus largely attended by his friends, colleagues, collaborators and more generally, by researchers who had somehow got acquainted with him or with his work throughout 36 years of research and educational activity in the field.",

To understand the impacts of the welding processes on the quality of welds, a comparative study was conducted to look into how a welding process can be selected to meet the expected quality of welds. The quality of welds was measured by weld appearance, microstructure and mechanical properties. The reported work has shown the quality difference of welds at the following aspects: (i) on the appearance of welds, the laser-MIG hybrid welding process led to fully reinforced welds, and the laser welding process resulted in uniformly underfilled welds with root sagging; (ii) On the porosity, the welds from the laser-MIG hybrid welding process was larger than that of the laser welding process; (iii) On bead microstructure, the welds from the laser- MIG hybrid welding process were equiaxed dendritic, and the grain sizes in the fusion zone (FZ) were coarser than that from laser welding process; (iv) On the distribution of microhardness, the microhardness at the heat-affected zone (HAZ) was lower than that at the FZ and the base metal (BM) in the laser welding process, while the microhardness at the FZ was higher than that in BM; and (v) Finally, the tensile strengths of welds from laser welding process and the laser-MIG hybrid welding process were 174 and 114 MPa, respectively. The tensile strength of welds from the laser welding process was up to 71.71% of that of the substrate.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new representation of numeric functions using a piecewise arithmetic expression. To represent a numeric function compactly, we partition the domain of the function into uniform segments, and transform the sub-function in each segment into an arithmetic spectrum. From this arithmetic spectrum, we derive an arithmetic expression, and obtain a piecewise arithmetic expression for the function. By using the piecewise arithmetic expression, we can increase the number of zero arithmetic coefficients significantly, and represent a numeric function more compactly than using a conventional single arithmetic expression. We also present an application of the piecewise arithmetic expression to design of numeric function generators (NFGs). Since the piecewise arithmetic expression has many zero coefficients and repeated coefficients, by storing only distinct nonzero coefficients in a table, we can significantly reduce the table size needed to store arithmetic coefficients. Experimental results show that the table size can be reduced to only a small percent of the table size needed to store all the arithmetic coefficients.",

Confirmation experiments were conducted under optimum conditions to verify the validity of the proposed methods, which indicates that the methods can be effectively applied to enhance and optimize the welding performance in pulsed Nd:YAG laser welding.",

However, various synthetic methods developed so far in controlling the shape of the bimetallic alloy nanocrystals are limited by the metal compositions and shape specificity. In this work, we report an experimental study for the critical role of reaction temperature on the shape-controlled synthesis of bimetallic Pt-Co nanocrystals. By varying the reaction temperature from 180 to 220°C, the resulting Pt-Co nanocrystals with different shapes such as concave cube, cube, and truncated cube were prepared. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the as-synthesized Pt-Co nanocrystals characterized monodispersed nanocrystals with good shape and size uniformities and their crystals structures.

This work is focussed on the energy engineering behind this most fascinating dilemma. The available ultrashort pulsed lasers are reviewed and the prospects of Attosecond to zeptosecond pulse generation barriers are discussed to investigate the potential solutions. Natural and rocket or laser triggered lightning are reviewed regarding pulse durations, inter-pulse periods, frequency of occurrence and number of pulses per flash in the light of available data. Laser pulses and lightning flashes of energy are evaluated critically in the more familiar kWh units and the prospects of causing very high power or energy pulsed events in highly repetitive (continuous) manner is analysed to develop sustainable ultimate energy sources. An attempt was made also to demonstrate that the available natural solar energy on one half of Earth’s surface is several billions times more than the present human survival needs. The possibilities of ultrashort pulsed lasers to record live movies of Attosecond to Zeptosecond short lived events and trigger Exa to Zettawatt threshold chemical, natural nuclear or artificial processes are discussed.",

In this study IPS instruction is embedded in a competence-based teachers education programme. The effect of the integrated instruction on students’ IPS process and task performance are determined. Analysis of thinking aloud protocols shows that IPS instruction has a positive effect on students’ regulation activities, ability to clarify task requirements and needed information, and the ability to judge the quality of sources and information.

Today, many software companies deliver their applications from a cloud system, which provides a valuable alternative for business buyers. Just like any other IT decision, the selecting proper cloud service provider contains various tangible and intangible criteria, which contain uncertainty and incomplete information. In this paper, selecting cloud service provider problem is modeled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, and a decision model involving seven criteria, 21 sub-criteria and four alternatives is proposed. The evaluations regarding the cloud alternatives are expressed as Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Pythagorean fuzzy sets are an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, in which the sum of membership and non-membership degrees may be larger than one whereas their square sum is at most equal to 1. This provides a larger range for decision makers to assign membership and non-membership degrees to an element of a fuzzy set. Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method is used to rank the alternatives. The robustness of the decision model is checked using one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis.",

The change of laser incident angle will directly change the energy distribution form, material damage threshold and paint removal efficiency of the material surface. MATLAB was used to simulate the spot morphology and energy centres distribution of different angles, to study the damage threshold of a 2024-T3 Al alloy and paint at different incidence angles by reference to the ISO 11254 1-on-1 laser damage threshold fluence test method, and to analyse the two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) morphology of the single-pulse laser spot and verify the results with the simulation. The results have shown that as the laser incidence angle decreases, the spot area increases and the threshold decreases, which effectively improves the energy availability rate and paint removal efficiency. The depth of the actual single-pulse action crater in the material was not affected by the angle of incidence, but the area increases and the offset of the energy centre on the geometric centre of the spot increases. The experimental and simulated values of energy density distribution, offset and craters diameter were well correlated and the errors were explained in terms of the mechanism of laser-material action.",

First, a binary image based on the object image is generated as an auxiliary image in the following steps. Second, the pixels in high density region and low density region are determined respectively, and the boundary pixels are filtered based on the local density analysis. Third, the principles of selecting some parameters are summarized and the calculation steps are shown. To examine the correction method, the results of an experimental application of local density segmentation are given to verify the feasibility and accuracy. The two novelties in this work are: (i) The defocused region is considered and processed in segmenting the VMR; and (ii) a segmentation method which can reduce the impacts from the spurious fringes and defocused region at the same time is proposed.",

However, after a prolonged cyclic test with increasing stresses from 65 to 95 MPa, the specimen fractured brittlely with almost no fiber pull-out. The microstructure analysis of the fracture surface showed different oxidation levels with respect to fracture locations, indicating that the crack propagated during the cyclic fatigue test. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the interface layer of pyrolytic carbon was removed by oxidation and oxide layers were formed on both sides of the fiber and matrix at the later stage of the cyclic test, resulting in a strong interface between the fibers and matrix and brittle fracture during the cyclic test at 1400°C.",

    "abstract": "According to the function of self-diagnosis and self-healing for smart composite structures health monitoring system, this paper proposed a smart structure based on liquid core optical fibre (LCOF) sensor network. A model of loads recognition algorithm based on particle swarm optimization-support vector regression (PSO-SVR) is presented to achieve the self-diagnosis of the LCOF sensor system. Furthermore, the loading experiments were conducted on the E-51 composite structures plate embedded with eight liquid core fibre sensors. The relationship between the changes of light intensity in fibre sensor and loads positions was researched on. The support vector regression (SVR) model was established using sample data to predict loads position. And the parameters were optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. And the test error is 0.245%. The study showed that this method can effectively determine the loads positions with small size training sample. It realized the self-diagnosis system for liquid core fibre sensors and it provides a foundation for the future research on the self repairing for smart composite structures.",

However, despite multiple generations of the development of the theory, there is still a lack of a stable, widely accepted definition. Definitions range from those that identify social presence based on media affordances and attributes to those that identify social presence as a phenomenal state that is experienced by participants. This paper outlines the history and evolution of social presence definitions and their corresponding measures. It concludes that the factors that contribute to social presence should be identified in a non-mediated setting, as a psychological construct, in order to stabilize the definition, which would then provide a more stable definition that could lead to more accurate measurement across environments, both mediated and non-mediated.",

Though QCA has demonstrated functional enhancement with respect to CMOS logic, its fabrication is yet ill defined and prone to manufacturing defects. In this regard we present a comprehensive Design for Testability of combinational QCAlogic irrespective of size and complexity. We show that by adopting the AND-OR design scheme, and introducing a block of ‘Test Enable’ Majority Voters inserted between inputs to the AND-OR block and the literal outputs of the inverting block with primary inputs, any logic is fully testable with only two test vectors. In hierarchical design, cascading individual modules reduces the observability of the fault. We address this issue and propose a single fault propagation path to detect any fault otherwise masked by the modular nature of the original logic. To verify our approach we use a modular 4-bit adder.",

In accordance, the TCA Workshop is related to traffic modeling, which includes vehicular traffic on highway networks, city traffic with signal control and public conveyance.

It is a QKD system that generates the first signals with different phases or polarization and the second signals with different frequencies and delay time. The transmitter sends the two signals to share the key with receiver. The key is formed by the states of the first and second signals. The method leads to increase the length of the shared key. The first signal is generated in different phases or polarization to protect the transmission channel and to be the reference time for second signal. Secure keys generated by the QKD network are managed in the key management layer by key management agents (KMAs), and used to encrypt the data and send it to receivers.

The process parameters such as laser power, scan speed and powder feed rate are selected to understand their influence on track width, track height and build rate during LAMDED of the thin Hastelloy-X walls. The investigation is further extended to develop empirical models defining the parametric influence with good agreement to experimental measurements. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis is performed to find out the significant process parameters affecting the geometry and build rate in LAM-DED. ANOVA analysis shows that the most significant control parameter for track width, track height and build rate are power with a contribution of 85.40%, scan speed with a contribution of 48.07% and powder feed rate with a contribution of 58.77%, respectively. Multi-objective optimization using Grey relational analysis (GRA) derived an optimal process parameter combination of power of 600 W, scan speed of 0.3 m/min and powder feed rate of 11 g/ min for maximum build rate and nominal track width of 1.7 mm. The developed methodology can be extended to LAM-DED of other track widths. The thin walls are successfully built using LAM-DED at the optimized process parameters and the measured track width of built wall is found to be within permissible limits. Macrostructural examination revealed that the built wall is defect-free in terms of cracks, porosity, foreign inclusions and similar defects. Microstructural examination shows fine dendritic growth in the direction of wall building. The work finds applications in building thin walled Hastelloy-X components of ultramodern systems, like Advanced Ultra Super Critical Power Plants involving extreme duty conditions.",

Experiments were carried out to validate the results predicted by the numerical model and to study the mechanical properties of laser bent specimen. It was observed that the Mg can be bent with laser without much deterioration in its mechanical properties such as strength and hardness. The developed model was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The developed numerical model was used to investigate the bending mechanism and the effects of process parameters on bend angle and edge effect in detail.

    "abstract": "A new multiple-valued current-mode integrated circuit based on dynamic source-coupled logic is proposed for a low-power arithmetic- oriented VLSI processor. A judicious combination of source-coupled logic and dynamic logic makes it possible to reduce the power dissipation while maintaining a high-speed switching capability because the dynamic logic style makes steady current flow cut off. As a typical example of a high-performance arithmetic circuit, a radix-2 signed-digit full adder based on the dynamic source-coupled logic is implemented using a 0.18mm CMOS technology. Its power dissipation is reduced to about 70 percent in comparison with that of a corresponding binary CMOS implementation",

The algorithm underlaying this method is the A* search one in combination with CAs, the discrete nature of which renders the method appropriate for both robot and obstacle state spaces. Moreover, the finite properties of the A* algorithm were amalgamated with the CA rules to built up a substantial search strategy. The proposed algorithm assures a collision-free cost-efficient path to target with optimal computational cost. The algorithm’s main attribute is that it expands the map state space with respect to time using adaptive time intervals to predict the potential expansion of obstacles, assuring a safe and minimum cost path. The proposed method has been examined in real world planar environments and exhibits remarkable performance, thus it can be applied to any arbitrary shaped obstacle.",

Biodegradable plastics are now emerging as one of the available options to solve such environmental issues. The industrial development of new biodegradable plastics and compostable plastics has been accompanied by the parallel development of suitable standard test methods. This paper presents the studies regarding the compliance with specific biodegradation conformity assessment criteria for three types of packages: polyethylene, oxo-biodegradable and polyethylene therephtalate plastics. It were studied the degradation and biodegradation level for plastics samples in aqueous conditions, by composting and exposure at UV irradiation. For the conformity assessment the following parameters have been determined: volatile organic compounds, total content of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb), moisture, ash content, total organic carbon and the degree of biodegradability in aqueous medium for oxo-biodegradable plastic and polyethylene. For the biodegradation processes conducted by composting in monitoring conditions a mixture has been used consisting in mature compost, vegetal waste resulted from fruits mark distillation, sawdust and the studied plastics. The parameters monitored are: moisture, total organic carbon, ash content, Kjeldhal nitrogen, pH and temperature. To identify the structural modifications in time IR spectra have been registered. The plastics tested meet the conformity conditions regarding composition (volatile organic compounds and heavy metals content) but not those referring to the conformity conditions for biodegradability.",

In this paper, laser with excellent frequency stability is proven to be able to drive an IFOG. As a result of its narrow linewidth, errors namely coherent backscattering, polarization coupling and Kerr effect are reintroduced. Based on the most advanced models, we analyse and calculate these terms approximately to demonstrate the feasibility of using laser as light source in an IFOG system theoretically. Its 3 dB linewidth is measured by delayed self-heterodyne interferometer and the high precision alignment method of fibre fusion is restated to reduce polarization error. By choosing the appropriate laser with a suitable driving current the noise of 0.010°∕√h, drift of 0.050 °∕h and scale factor stability of 1.88 ppm are achieved simultaneously. As the wavelength stability of broadband light source is becoming more and more difficult to improve, laser-driven IFOG will be a potential research direction in the future.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) focuses on the study and the subsequent advances and inventions in machines, systems, and other human intelligence objects, distinguished by thinking skills, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capability. Artificial intelligence is widely formulated and applied in varying ways in education, particularly by universities/colleges. AI is primarily established as information technology, a shift to internet-based and online intelligent education systems, and, eventually, integrated computer systems, other technologies, robotic devices, and internet Talkbots to execute teachers’ roles and duties individually or through instructors. Talkbots are limited to audio and text inputs. The Real-Time Communication and AI- multimedia service assistance to the learners and teachers helps the education for a higher level of performance. Another trending aspect of higher education is virtual reality or augmented reality. This research designs AI-assisted Real-Time Communication and AI-multimedia Services Framework (AI-RCMF) to support higher education in universities/colleges. The Recurrent- Convolutional Neural Network applies for information decoding from AI-multimedia resources and Dimensional Pose estimation from augmented reality objects. The simulation analysis performed for this framework results in 94.68% accuracy. The other performance metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score are evaluated in the research to compare the proposed model with existing frameworks for higher education.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of an automatic wireless sensor monitoring system for civil engineering structures. The objective is to provide a solution to measure both temperature and humidity inside a concrete structure. The research has been focused in the early age and curing phase period. Four solutions have been addressed. The first one involves the use of a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor and an IRIS mote allowing for the creation of an IEEE 802.15.4 network. However, the results have shown that the sensor measurements present a 5 C standard deviation between the actual and the experimental values. The second one considers the use of the SHT15 (humidity/temperature) sensor, together with the PIC18F4680 microcontroller or the Arduino platform. The third solution involves the use of the SHT21S (humidity/ temperature) sensor and the eZ430-RF2500 wireless development tool platform for the MSP430 microcontroller. In this case, the temperature readings were successfully performed for the first 16 h, while the humidity values were successfully obtained for the first 24 h of the experiment. Although the set of measured values is very promising for the SHT15 and SHT21S sensors, both sensors have stopped working after some time, showing that direct contact between the sensor and the concrete alkaline environment causes its breakdown. Finally, the fourth solution considers both the SHT15 and SHT21S sensors completely shielded allowing for the creation of a long-term solution. As, the SHT15 and SHT12S sensors have not been affected by the alkaline environment for more than two months of operation, enabling real-time and continuous monitoring with almost non-intrusive tiny devices, the potential of applying the proposed inexpensive wireless sensor network approach is verified.",

However, the expression of preferences is often a very difficult task for the experts, specially in decision problems with a high number of alternatives and when experts use fuzzy preference relations to provide their opinions. This usually leads to situations where experts are not able to properly express all their preferences in a consistent way, that is, without contradiction. In this paper, to overcome this problem, we present a decision support system based on consistency criteria to aid experts to express their fuzzy preference relations in a more consistent way. The system works interactively with the expert by providing him/her recommendations on the preference values that he/she has not yet expressed. These recommendations are computed trying to maintain the expert’s consistency level as high as possible.",

The algorithm uses several communication states to explicitly detect when the first (shrinking) stage has ended, and relying only on local state information the cellular automaton is able to begin the next (expanding) stage of the computation in such a way that correctness is ensured.",

Small air bubbles are injected into still water from a nozzle below a square-section cylinder, and the rising bubbles induce a bubble plume around the cylinder. The side length of the cylinder is equivalent to the nozzle width. The two-dimensional vortex method for gas-liquid two-phase flow, proposed by the authors in a prior paper, is employed for the simulation. The bubbles injected from the nozzle rise vertically. The bubbles colliding with the front of the cylinder flow along the lateral sides, and they leave the cylinder. The bubbles above the cylinder rise in two lines. The water velocity on the horizontal cross-sections satisfies the similarity distribution around the plume centerline. The cylinder affects the water flow in the upper region. The water velocity and the strength for the large-scale eddies are lower than those of the plume without the cylinder. But the vertical component of the turbulent intensity is two times higher, and the water flow spreads more toward the horizontal direction.",

To validate our methods, we used students’ performance on these multiple-choice questions to predict their scores on the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test. A model based on students’ cloze performance predicted their Passage Comprehension scores with correlation R = .85. The percentage of vocabulary words that students matched correctly to their definitions predicted their Word Comprehension scores with correlation R = .61. We used both types of questions in a within-subject automated experiment to compare four ways to preview new vocabulary before a story – defining the word, giving a synonym, asking about the word, and doing nothing. Outcomes included comprehension as measured by performance on multiple-choice cloze questions during the story, and vocabulary as measured by matching words to their definitions in a posttest after the story. A synonym or short definition significantly improved posttest performance compared to just encountering the word in the story – but only for words students didn’t already know, and only if they had a grade 4 or better vocabulary. Such a preview significantly improved performance during the story on cloze questions involving the previewed word – but only for students with a grade 1-3 vocabulary.",

Training using video occlusion targets the time frame, measured in less than one-half second, which is associated with expert perception and decision-making. This is the first such study to measure transfer of video training to game performance. Video training in pitch recognition was associated with significantly better batting averages for college baseball players, as measured by rank correlation.

In this paper was established a predictive approach by adaptive neuro-fuzzy logic interference system (ANFIS) to determine the impact of fluence, scanning speed, number of shots, number of passes and pulse repetition rate on the mean depth of ablation. Since the depth of ablation affects total internal reflection and insertion loss there is need to analyse the depth in the comprehensive approach. It was found that the number of shots and scanning speed in combination is the most important for the mean depth of ablation. The results could be useful for laser ablation optimization in order to reduce the cost of the process.",

    "abstract": "With the large-scale application of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in warehousing and logistics, it becomes crucial to study the factors that affect the reading performance of RFID tags. To address this issue this paper builds an experimental testing system to deeply study the influence of tag position distribution on the tags’ reading performance; however, in tag position measurement process, due to the complex electromagnetic interference in the dynamic state, normal tag position measurement by using antenna may cause errors or even mistakes. So in this paper the image processing non-contact method is adopted to replace the antenna to realize tags’ position measurement. After that, the newly emerged deep neural network (DNN) is developed to deeply explore the complex nonlinear relationship existing between the tag position distribution and corresponding reading distance. The established DNN is used to predict the reading distance of tag group. By analysing the predicted reading distance, we may find the optimal three-dimensional (3-D) position distribution corresponding to the maximum reading distance. The method proposed in this paper can be used to guide the position distribution of tags in practical scenarios and thus improve the reading performance of RFID system.",

The car first searches for the remotest convex point at a border and fixes the next goal nearby it. Then it moves to it stepwise, first accelerating and then decelerating. It is shown that this strategy allows the cars to move automatically and safely around the circuit. Third, the whole system is modeled by a CA compatible model (GCA-w). This model allows an intuitive description and reduces the computational effort. Further promising research is outlined.",

The use of interventions which are external actions that alter the natural behavior of the system allows to distinguish causal relations from spurious correlations. The proposed approach is based on the concepts of acceptance and rejection instead of changes in uncertainty distributions to discriminate between potential causes. More different definitions of acceptance and rejection are introduced allowing the categorization of causes according to their strength. In this model, even accepted, an event can be confirmed or attenuated. Different strengths of facilitation and justification, concepts complementary to the concept of causality, are also discussed in this paper.",

This is a macroscopic, biological example of the “majority identification problem” studied in the cellular automaton literature. By closely adhering to the empirical conditions of these experiments we have developed a “directed majority” cellular automaton that: (a) solves the identification problem well even for small initial majorities; (b) explains why untrained fish help persuade minority fish to join the majority; and (c) predicts that untrained fish achieve this feat by collaborating in spatially structured cliques that might be observable in experiments with larger populations. The directed majority automaton provides insight into the consensus forming process and holds promise for being able to predict when systems (similar to the fish) will successfully perform majority identification.",

    "abstract": "Welding of aluminium alloy with low carbon steel is a difficult work due to the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds, and the use of laser welding technology by strictly control the welding parameters is a possible solution to surpass this problem. In other words, the laser welding input parameters has always played a very important role in welding aluminium alloy with low carbon steel process, especially in determining the quality of the weld joint. The quality of the weld joint can be evaluated in terms of properties such as weld bead distortion, von Mises stress and heat affected zone (HAZ) area. In this study, a three-dimensional (3-D) finite element method (FEM) model is used to simulate the steel to aluminium alloy laser welding process. The laser welded panel stress, HAZ and distortions can be calculated with the simulation FEM software (SYSWELD), taking into account all relevant physical phenomena. Orthogonal design is used to perform the experimental design and the selection of the experiment factors, levels and indexes are also revealed. The method of orthogonal polynomial regression is used for regression modelling to establish the relationship between the laser welding input parameters like laser power, welding speed and beam angle. Response surface methodology (RSM) was adopted for optimizing the process parameters. The optimal condition to have a quality weld is found at 1700 W of laser power, 40 mm/s of welding speed and 30o of beam angle. The study also observed that the effect of welding speed is more significant than other welding parameters. Finally, a confirmatory simulation experiment has been carried out to verify the optimal setting so obtained.",

As a result, academics, particularly decision science researchers have been working so hard over the years to develop appropriate multicriteria decision making methods to aid decision makers in their quest to establish the optimum decisions in their respective fields and problems. In this paper, a technique for decision making in environments characterised by the availability of incompletely ignorant facts, partially conflicting and vague information is proposed. The technique is dependent on paraconsistent logic, Pavelka style fuzzy logic and fuzzy similarity relations. To demonstrate the use of the technique, it is applied to the selection of the best or optimal five energy mix from eight electricity generation sources for Ghana.",

The formation of plasma acoustic wave was analysed during laser shock processing and the signals with or without water restraint under different power densities were investigated experimentally. It’s found that the processing parameters have a remarkable influence on the amplitude of the plasma acoustic wave signals and low influence on waveform. The spreading speed of acoustic signal with water confining layer is higher than the speed of it without water confining layer, and higher power density also improves the amplitude of the signal. The variables are then analysed in order to evaluate correlations. The increase in intensity of signal is found to be essentially due to shock wave pressure. The envelop spectrums of the acoustic wave signal with the ablative layer well kept and broken are similar in high frequency area, while in the frequency from 0 to 80 kHz the envelop spectrums are quite different. It is supposed that the breaking of ablative layer reduced the creation efficiency of plasma, and the shacking frequency of plasma area is also changed. This method can be also applied for the acoustic wave diagnose in the interaction between laser plasma shock wave and materials.",

The virus is constantly changing, and with mutations, it becomes diverse and spreads more easily. Several automatic COVID-19 diagnostic tools are proposed that emphasize feature extraction mechanism from radiographical images using modern deep learning technology. The general idea is to leverage smart solutions of pre-trained networks for deep-feature processing. However, all the extracted features may not essentially contribute to the performance of the COVID-19 diagnostic model, and hence an optimal subset of features must be discovered. Motivated by this, we propose a novel feature selection method based on multi-operator differential evolution (MODE), which helps to acquire optimal feature-subset. To show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we focus on applying the COVID-19 classification model through medical imaging. Eight advanced pre-trained architectures have been selected for COVID-19 feature extraction from CT-scan medical imaging. After that, the proposed feature selection technique based on MODE is applied. A customized SVM kernel is implemented that supports feature classification. The result analysis shows the performance of the existing COVID-19 designs with the proposed feature selection technique, MODE, integrated with a customized SVM kernel. It even beats the existing state-of-the-art frameworks carried forward for COVID-19 diagnosis. We have observed that MODE feature selection is suitable for fast COVID-19 detection, having overall accuracy of 85.27%.",

Thus, it is possible to consider the genetic code as a partially defined multiple-valued function of a 20-valued logic. Consideration of the genetic code within the proposed mathematical model makes it possible to learn the code using a multilayer neural network based on multi-valued neurons (MLMVN). MLMVN is a neural network with traditional feedforward architecture, but with a highly efficient derivative-free learning algorithm and higher functionality than the one of the traditional feedforward neural networks and a variety of kernel-based networks. It is shown that the genetic code multiple-valued function can be easily trained by a significantly smaller MLMVN in comparison with a classical feedforward neural network.",

    "abstract": "There exist problems in fuzzy finite element methods because technique of solving fuzzy equations is not perfect. For example, computation amount is too big and both sides of the equality are not exactly equal when solutions are substituted into the original equation. The concept of monosource fuzzy number is developed to simplify the calculation process of fuzzy equations. However the source of fuzziness in practical engineering is difficult to be judged and the source of fuzzy coefficient is non-unique. Indeed, no efficient method is available to solve fuzzy finite element equations. In this paper, fuzzy coefficient programming is combined with the essence of elasticity. In other words, the force equilibrium of elastic object is the process of minimizing energy of a quadratic equation. A new fuzzy finite element solution and a new neural network algorithm of fuzzy finite element are developed. The method was proved to be efficient and feasible through circuit simulation.",

Different types of 3-D scanning patterns based on a 2-D scanner is discussed. Both hardware design and software implementation are introduced in detail to allow readers easily re-implement the system. Photorealistic point clouds acquired through field test performed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios are shown and then data processing techniques are introduced, such as point cloud denoising, reduction and registration. Experiments regarding performance evaluation demonstrate that its positional accuracy is around 3 mm at 4 m, average spatial distance accuracy 3.6 mm and flatness 2.1 mm. Besides, the result of 3-D modelling a woodcarving indicates its promising performance relative to cost.

The processed speckle images offer the outcome results as roughness values. The bright or white to the black or dark pixel ratio is computed from the binary imaging pattern of the speckle.

    "abstract": "Jaundice is one of the highest prevalent conditions demanding attention in newborn babies. Infants with high blood levels of bilirubin called hyperbilirubinaemia, evolve the yellow color when bilirubin acquires in the skin. The major symptom of jaundice is yellow coloring of the skin and conjunctiva of the eyes. Jaundice can also make babies sleepy, which can lead to poor feeding. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia can be caused by dehydration, lack of adequate nutritional intake, extravasation of blood, cephalohematoma, contusion and may be potentially cause kernicterus. Because many of these problems affect newborns, they may require critical care from specialty medical disciplines. Thus, in this paper a combination of the Maximal Information Compression Index (MICI) for redundant feature elimination with PSO optimization for complexity reduction is proposed. Statistical features are derived from the texture images and used as features to quantify infant image textures. Finally, a Kernel SVM (Support Vector Machine) is employed as a classifier for selecting infant image textures. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can act as a supplement to support earlier detection and more effective treatment due to improved jaundice detection.",

The algorithm uses the information about the fuzzy cash flow linked to each project activity to prioritize the activities. The prioritization takes into account not only the cash flow of each activity, but also of the activities which follow it. Then the schedule is constructed in such a way that the highest priority activities, together with their predecessors, are scheduled first. As comparing fuzzy numbers is not unequivocal, a large part of the paper is devoted to this problem. It is indicated how much the order of the fuzzy priorities of the activities depends on the attitude and preferences of the decision maker. Various ranking methods of fuzzy priorities are presented, for various types of decision makers, and it is shown how the final project schedule depends on the project manager attitude. The procedure is then applied to an example (for various decision maker attitudes) and results are discussed in conclusions.",

The various notations for logic are designed to represent the final precise stage, but they provide no intermediate forms that can bridge the gap between an initial vague idea and its ultimate formalization.

To determine the optimal laser-welding parameters, a set of mathematical models were developed relating welding parameters to each of the weld characteristics. These were validated both statistically and experimentally. The quality criteria set for the weld to determine optimal parameters were maximization of resistance width and linear shearing strength. Laser power and welding speed in the range 3.61 to 3.69 kW and 7.59 to 7.88 m/min, respectively, with irradiation angles of 65 to 70º were identified as the optimal set of process parameters. However, the laser power and welding speed can be reduced to 3.50 to 3.51 kW and increased to 7.87 to 7.98 m/min, respectively, to obtain minimum distortion and better welds..",

The pellets are placed in a test section made of quartz and exposed to the hot gas, whose temperature ranges from 500ºC to 900ºC. Their sizes are between 5 to 40 mm. We have also conducted the numerical simulation based on the VOF method, to investigate the detailed physics of the melting phenomena. The pellets are melted down via an oval shape from the initial cylindrical shape at each temperature, although the firing has been observed at the high temperature of 900ºC. The PP yields higher melting rate than the LDPE in spite of its higher melting temperature. The melting process can be predicted by a simple heat balance when the sample diameter is small. The detailed melting process for the larger sample is predicted by the numerical simulation.",

This paper presents a theoretical modelling approach (based on Mie theory) to optimise the optical properties of nanoshells for these applications. To check that this approach works for real (non-uniform) nanoshell samples, this model is validated by comparison with experimental data. To demonstrate this approach, this paper describes the process used to obtain a specific gold and silver nanofluid for a pump-probe radiation experiment. Owing to the nature of the proposed experiment, the resulting water-based nanofluid consists of two types of nanoshells, one which effectively absorbs the pump’s radiation while the other scatters the probe’s radiation. Thus, the optimum nanofluid contains gold/silica nanoshells of 37.6 nm core radius and 2.4 nm shell thickness (for absorbing the pump radiation) and silver/silica nanoshells of 10.8 nm core radius and 49.2 nm shell thickness (for scattering the probe radiation). The proposed nanofluid design procedure, however, represents a general approach that can be adopted to design nanofluids for other optical experiments and applications.",

Almost all recent advances in the field have relied on methods requiring crystalline samples; as a consequence, relatively little is known about the so-called amorphous regions of either cellulose or starch, or the relationship between crystalline and noncrystalline regions. Parametric nonlinear optical properties such as second harmonic generation, sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, and third harmonic generation are ideally suited for studying both crystalline and amorphous regions in intact samples. In this paper we review the nonlinear optical properties of cellulose and starch in the context of their molecular and supramolecular structure.We speculate on specific questions that could be addressed with this approach, and how they might contribute to a better understanding of common structural themes in biological macromolecules.",

In particular we show that filtering unification depends on the monoid operation, that is, unification is filtering in varieties generated by residuated lattices without zero divisors.

The transient temperature distributions and the damage threshold of thermal decomposition with different absorption rates are simulated. Results show that the higher absorption rate causes the higher temperature rise on the material surface, but the desired damage threshold of thermal decomposition is lower. Increasing the laser energy density, the surface damage of thermal decomposition occurs more early.

The two recent advances of deep architectures in the computer vision and natural language processing are utilized to try to bridge the semantic gap of the image contents and human perception. Given the test images, different regions and scales of image are densely sampled as the candidates. The two strategies, saliency reduction and non-maximum suppression integration, are performed to remove the redundancy and retain the convincing candidates. We employ the convolutional neural network for candidate annotations. Based on the word embedding, a deep language architecture is trained to calculate the relatedness of the input query text and annotations. We also formulate a transition matrix to measure relative importance and transfer the references among the annotations. The experimental results on a nursery school dataset demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Two high β (hyperpolarizability) chromophores with covalently attached alkoxybenzoyl-coumarin groups are demonstrated herein to exemplify significantly increased order (both centric and acentric) and electro-optic activity compared to their conventional chromophore-polymer poled counterparts. Through measurements of order and viscoelastic behavior, related to molecular cooperativity, the coumarins are shown to inflict a reduction in lattice dimensionality on the electro-optic (EO) chromophore units of the system. This reduction in lattice dimensionality has been further corroborated with theoretical simulations employing Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics methods. This method of incorporating active nano-engineered interactions for effect on molecular order can be further explored to yield additional improvement in both order and EO activity. Indeed, it is conceivable that this nano-engineering approach can also be extended to other organic material systems with applications other than EO (e.g. field-effect transistors or photovoltaics).",

Our results reveal that the scattering and absorption coefficients of stomach vary with the change in wavelength; namely, at 870 nm the value of absorption coefficient was higher than at 633 nm for normal tissue while scattering coefficients shows the opposite trend than absorption coefficient in case of stomach. While in case of whole blood, we have explored that in the presences of the asymmetrical type of particles, the scattering coefficients decreases and absorption coefficient increases for all sucrose concentrations (0 to 400 mM); moreover, we concluded that the decrease in scattering for higher concentrations is due to refractive index mismatch effect between red blood cells and blood plasma.

As the nominal precision of modern laser trackers is better than ±0.05 mm, the use of this technology becomes very attractive and opens new interesting scenarios in static monitoring with the measurement of new different quantities. After reviewing the current state of the art in the field of structure inspection, some real applications are presented in which a laser tracker was employed to measure structure displacements.

The proposed filter is built around the commercially available current-feedback operational-amplifier (CFOA). The bandwidth of each notch can be independently controlled, without disturbing the gain of the comb filter and the notch frequency, by adjusting the gain of an external voltage amplifier built around a CFOA. The gain of this CFOAbased voltage amplifier is controlled by adjusting a variable grounded resistance. This grounded resistance can be implemented, if desired, using an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) configured as a grounded resistance. The proposed shadow comb filter enjoys the attractive feature of low output impedance. This would facilitate cascading of comb filters to obtain any number of notch frequencies. Experimental results obtained from a shadow comb filter with 4 notch frequencies using the AD844 CFOA are presented. These results confirm the functionality of the proposed comb filter both for low as well as high notch frequencies.",

The impact of intensity dependent dispersive parameter on pico second optical pulse evolution in an optical fiber has been investigated using mathematical modeling. The pulse behavior is analyzed by incorporating Kerr non-linearity effect on group velocity dispersion (GVD) parameter β 2 and third-order dispersion (TOD) parameter β 3 . The complete study is done for different pulse width and different input intensities. Bloch equations are used to obtain polarization induced in the medium due to incident Gaussian pulse. The analysis of induced polarization is done by using non linear Schrodinger equation. Intensity dependent dispersive parameters result in broadening of pulse with an additional temporal shift on the propagating pulse due to intensity effect. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation reveals that for high optical intensities, intensity dependent dispersive effects become more important.",

In such materials, the orientation of the additives can become a complicated function of the sample configuration, manufacturing method, thermal history, and so on. Consequently, thermal analysis by conventional techniques may lead to varying results due to the difference between the configuration of the measurement specimen and the actual target material. In order to minimize such discrepancy, an in situ thermal characterization technique is needed. In this study, a microheater on a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer is proposed as an attachable thermal conductivity measurement device. The proposed device can simply be attached to the target of interest and measurement can be performed similar to the conventional “3-omega” method. A sensitivity analysis is performed to provide insight and guideline on the sensor design and testing, and to study the effect of the sample thermal conductivity on the temperature oscillation measured at the microheater. The relationship between the substrate thermal conductivity and the temperature oscillation at the microheater is analyzed through comparing sensitivity parameters calculated for different values of design variables: input frequency, thickness of the PDMS layer, and microheater width. The results suggest that measurement at low temperature oscillation frequency (2 W/m/K), both amplitude and phase lag of the temperature oscillation should be utilized.",

In order to increase the robustness of detection, parameter settings in pulse interval patterns are also analysed, based on the evaluation models.",

Experimental results indicate that the conductivities of carbonaceous slate slightly increased with increasing temperatures and pressures, respectively. At a certain temperature range, the conductivities of carbonaceous slate follow an Arrhenius relation. There are three Arrhenius relations for the conductivities of carbonaceous slate at a certain pressure. From high temperature range to low temperature range, the activation enthalpies for the conductivities of carbonaceous slate are found to be 0.02‒0.03 eV, 0.05‒0.06 eV, and 0.11‒0.13 eV, respectively. Electron conduction is proposed to be the conduction mechanism for carbonaceous slate at high temperatures and pressures. It is suggested that the unusually high conductivities of carbonaceous slate (0.1‒1 S/m) are associated to interconnected amorphous carbon. Furthermore, the electrical conductivities of carbonaceous rocks can be used to interpret the high-conductivity layers (HCLs) in the Earth’s interior.",

The welding speed ranging from 2.0 m/min to 3.0 m/min was suitable for laser welding of the studied maraging steel sheet. Hardness survey across the aged weldments revealed that hardness peaks in different zones after aging treatments occurred at different temperatures: 420°C for parent metal zone (PMZ), 460°C for the heat affected zone (HAZ) and 500°C for fusion zone (FZ). Hardness became higher in HAZ and FZ than in PMZ above 420°C and so the tensile failure location occurred in PMZ above aging temperature of 420°C. Among the applied aging treatments, aging at 460°C achieved the highest tensile strength of laser weldments.",

According to our measure, Riemann Hypothesis is more complex than Goldbach’s Conjecture. We also show, in a non-constructive way, that the Collatz 3x +1 Problem is finitely refutable; consequently, our method cannot be applied, hence stronger versions of this problem are studied.",

Using relatively low power laser sources of specific wavelengths (green 532nm and blue 405nm) it was shown that waves could be reproducibly initiated within the BZ vesicles. Furthermore, despite the reduced excitability of the system overall the initiated waves exhibited vesicle to vesicle transfer. It was possible to manipulate single vesicles and design simple circuits based on a 2D validation of collision based circuits. Therefore, we conclude that this BZ system exhibits promise for computing applications based on 3D networks of vesicles.",

    "abstract": "Equipment has been developed to enable KrF excimer laser ablation machining of a bisphenol A polycarbonate sample under closed thick film flowing liquid immersion. The liquid medium is easily changeable, offering the possibility of chemical modification of the material etching mechanism. Previous work using a medium of filtered tap water has proven the ability of this equipment to control debris; however, this medium had the simultaneous consequence of modifying the primary ablation characteristics from those achieved in ambient air. De-ionized (DI) water is a chemically similar medium that displays contrasting electrostatic properties and was used in this work with the intention of modifying the adhesion mechanisms active. Use of DI water resulted in close agreement of ablation characteristics observed using filtered tap water. Etch rate and threshold displayed a marginal loss in machining efficiency by magnitudes of 11.7% and 4.3% respectively when using DI water for immersion of laser ablation compared to filtered water. This loss is proposed to be caused by increased colloidal grouping of small debris particles to form medium sized items that more completely attenuate the laser beam. As with filtered water, the etch efficiency was also found to be flow velocity dependent due to changing fluid flow-plume interaction states. The mode of debris control afforded by the use of DI water as a laser ablation immersion medium was similar to that of filtered water. But, the volume of debris deposited was significantly greater and was deposited in closer proximity to the feature. Electrostatic insulation by DI water allows greater attraction of particles to the surface due to the suppression of Yukawa forces. Moreover, the action of colloidal aggregation of particles caused DI water to deposit a proportionally large volume of medium sized debris when compared to the proportional population of medium sized debris deposited by filtered water. This work demonstrates that choice of medium offers the immersed laser ablation user control of ablation characteristics without modification of laser parameters.",

    "abstract": "Excimer laser based projection micromachining process is a popular method of engraving miniaturized complex patterns on metallic/organic surfaces. Acoustic signals are generated during the process due to the interaction of a laser beam with the photoresist material. These acoustic signals are analysed to explore the possibility of using Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques for on-line monitoring of the ablation of the photoresist coating. On-line monitoring of the acoustic signals was accomplished using resonant sensors of frequencies 30 kHz &175 kHz,during laser ablation with various laser powers. The Root Mean Square (RMS)voltage value of each AE signal was analysed. The AE signals recorded by a 175 kHz resonant frequency sensor did not show any change during the entire ablation process. However,there was a considerable drop in the RMS voltage value for the 30 kHz sensor for all fluences (pulse energies), when the coating is removed, and this can be used to monitor and control the laser ablation process. There was a considerable fluctuation in the AE signal strength (RMS Voltage) at lower pulse energy values such as 90 mJ and 135 mJ, due to the large fluctuation in the laser pulse energy from one pulse to another when it was set at lower values. The variation in the number of laser pulses needed for the complete removal of the photoresist coating at various laser pulse energies was also studied. It was observed that the number of laser pulses needed for the complete removal of the photoresist coating of a given thickness decreases with increasing laser fluence until it attains saturation at the fluence of 0.63 J/cm 2. The frequency spectrum analysis of AE signals during different stages of the ablation process was done and frequency peaks in 2 –8 kHz range found disappeared when the removal of photoresist coating is over. The results of all these studies are discussed in this paper.",

It is suggested that missing of various physical and chemical factors influencing the processes of electrical current formation in polymer composites is one of the main reasons of the mentioned divergence between theory and experimental results among which the rate of the values of inter- and intra-phase interactions in composites may be considered as a very important factor. The peculiarities of dependence of the conductivity of systems with binary conducting fillers are considered in this work as well.",

If the input state crosses the given threshold then only the output will change. A leakage power reduction technique like DTCMOS (dynamic-threshold CMOS) is applied in this paper due to which leakage current and power consumption has been reduced. Dynamic threshold MOSFET (DTCMOS) transistor uses dynamic body bias because in DTCMOS, substrate (or body) and gate of MOSFET are tied together. In this paper the 4T Schmitt trigger with DTCMOS is compared with the proposed Schmitt trigger using DTCMOS. The tool at which the simulation has been done is cadence virtuoso at 45nm technology. The result shows the leakage power reduction for the proposed work. Leakage current by using DTCMOS technique is 7pA.",

The material of the vessel is generally stainless-steel, and it is fabricated by welding. To reduce the amount of the thermal conduction, materials having low thermal conductivity are chosen. Glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) is one of the adequate candidate materials because it has low thermal conductivity and high mechanical strength. We use GFRP pipe instead of stainless-steel pipe, as a neck in a liquid nitrogen vessel (or Dewar). Epoxy, as a bonding material, is inserted between the GFRP neck and the main body of the vessel. Therefore, the thermal characteristics, especially the thermal expansion, are very important because the vessel is cooled and warmed periodically. The experimental results of thermal expansion between room temperature and the low temperature are presented in the paper. Leakage in a vacuum environment is incurred because of different linear thermal expansion coefficients of various materials. The leakage is investigated using a vacuum-level checking method during the thermal cycle. In addition, the amount of boil-off in a low temperature vessel is discussed in terms of the thermal characteristics of the neck’s material.",

    "abstract": "Determining the most appropriate CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) system is considered as a critical decision making problem for production systems due to the fact that expectations and requirements of each production system have different nature for CAM system selection. Providing a scientific and systematic basis for design process, Axiomatic Design (AD) is based on two design axioms, namely independence axiom and information axiom which facilitates the selection of the best alternative that has the minimum information content. What is more, subjectivity and vagueness in the CAM system selection problem requires the consideration of fuzzy logic. The consideration of fuzzy logic provides the convenience of using linguistic terms during the evaluation of CAM systems. In this paper, a fuzzy information axiom based decision making approach is proposed to select the CAM system. Additional functional requirements are identified for CAM system selection problem for providing a comprehensive CAM-specific decision making model which has not yet been developed. Decision making process has been supported by means of a software which includes fuzzy AD. The proposed approach is applied to CAM system selection of a real life mould production system. Finally, the robustness of the decision is validated via the sensitivity analysis.",

The conventional drilling process face difficulties to drill good quality and precise holes in such types of advanced materials due to its better mechanical properties. Laser drilling may be applied to produce high quality hole geometry by operating the machine at optimum input parameters level. Keeping this fact in mind, the objective of the present research has been decided. The objective of present research is to optimize simultaneously hole circularity at exit and entry as well as hole taper in the laser trepan drilling of Inconel-718. The second order regression models for hole circularity at entrance, circularity at exit and hole taper have been developed. The genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied for the simultaneous optimization of different quality characteristics.

The effects of process parameters including pulse frequency, pulse width and focal plane position on the hole geometrical characteristics (hole entrance and exit diameter, circularity and hole taper) was studied using response surface methodology (RSM). Then optimization of the laser percussion drilling process was performed by multi-response optimizer within the Minitab 18 statistical software. The results show that the higher pulse frequency leads to greater hole entrance and exit diameter, less hole entrance and exit circularity and lower hole taper. By increasing the pulse width, the hole entrance and exit diameter increases while the hole entrance and exit circularity decreases. Also, the hole taper reduces by increasing the pulse width. Increasing the focal plane position leads to increase the hole entrance and exit diameter, decrease the hole entrance and exit circularity and reduce the hole taper. The experimental values obtained from optimization reveal that the error percentage for the hole entrance diameter, the hole exit diameter, the hole entrance circularity, the hole exit circularity and the hole taper are 0.4, 3.1, 8.0, 8.7 and 17.0%, respectively.",

A mathematical model was established for clad geometric features and dilution rate. Analysis of variance of test results shows that, the greater the pulse width, the greater the clad dilution rate; synergy of large output current and low scanning speed will give rise to greater clad width-to-height ratio. Through analysis and discussion, a set of optimum laser process parameters were obtained, and based on verification test, the errors between predicted value and measured value for the optimum process parameters were small, indicating high confidence level of this regression prediction model.",

Different concentrations of salt were admixed in water, blood plasma and whole blood samples have been investigated to monitor the effect of salt on whole blood using optical coherence tomography. We have successfully measured the viscosity of these samples by measuring the autocorrelation function based on M-mode data under dynamic light scattering in the Brownian motion regime. The effect of the shape of erythrocytes/aggregations on the signal in case of the whole blood sample has been explored exclusively. Conclusively, the diffusion of salt changes the refractive indices of mediums and increases aggregation of erythrocytes and forms rouleaux in whole blood. Autocorrelation functions in the simulation approach of optical coherence tomography were processed by applying inverse Fourier transforms to get the depth profiles of the characteristic signal. The relation between concentrations of salt and viscosity of signal yield the straight-line regressions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a new methodology to charge the mobile phone battery, in absence of wires and plugs, since the mobile phone becomes a necessity in our daily routine. Hence more, the mobile technology has been developed quickly within the last few years. However, regardless of how much it has improved or even fully grown, all its obtainable applications become useless, unless the mobile battery is charged enough to turn it on. The proposed system is designed to charge a mobile phone wirelessly from another mobile. The designed system aims to transmit power from one mobile to another wirelessly, using inductive power transmission (IPT) technology. The designed circuit is simulated to test its performance. Then, a prototype device is implemented. Many experiments are conducted to study the proposed system performance. The results of the simulations were very close to the experimental results and both shows that the proposed design meets the requirements and the aim it was designed for.",

An electrochemical work station was used to evaluate the corrosion behaviour of AlFeCuCrCoNi coating in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution with the help of potentiodynamic polarization measurement. The microstructural observation reveals that the equiaxed multi principal element coating composed of clad zone (CZ), bond zone (BZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that elemental segregation is efficiently reduced, and elements are uniformly distributed in the cladding. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the presence of two phases; namely, face-centred cubic (FCC) and body-centred cubic (BCC) phases. The findings suggested that HEA underwent pitting and there was no evidence of uniform corrosion. The study contributes to the understanding of corrosion phenomena.",

First of all, the mathematical measurement model is established. The mapping relationship between the two-dimensional (2-D) image and the three-dimensional (3-D) outside dimensions of forgings can be acquired. Secondly, a light plane translational scanning model is derived, and the optical centre motion trail is calculated by using linear regression analysis in this paper. Finally, the measurement of forging’s overall outside dimensions is realized by a data fusion of each section’s dimension information through continuous scanning the forging and the real-time capturing images.

Image denoising and restoration can help to enhance the image quality; however, the resolution is still limited. Image super resolution reconstruction (SRR) is a widely used technique for improving resolution beyond the limit of hardware. Projections onto convex sets (POCS) is one of the most popular SRR methods for its flexibility of incorporating prior knowledge such as the point spread function (PSF) of imaging system. A better understanding of the PSF can improve the accuracy of the POCS method, thus, the presented effort reviews several PSF models including a simplified PSF model based on beam propagation and applies them to the POCS method for an underwater range-gated pulsed laser imaging system. From experimental results, we can conclude that the combination of PSF can effectively enhance the performance of the POCS reconstruction for underwater laser imaging.",

These cellular automata are called variable-length shifts, and in previous works they were referred to as elector automata.

Still, most previous studies utilized the simulated pattern to replace the real rotation object, which is far from the practical applications. In this paper we investigate a laser -based method of rotation speed measurement based on the RDE by employing a real rotating metal disk in different conditions. We detect different rotational speeds ranging from 113.10 to 697.40 rad/s with superimposed optical vortices of constant topological charges 𝑙=±16. Meanwhile, related experiments are performed under the condition of different topological charges ranging from 𝑙=±12 to 𝑙=±25 at constant rotation speed of 590.68 rad/s. Typically, we employ optical vortices with different quality to explore its impact on detection accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We achieve good results that the relative errors are less than 0.5% and the SNRs are higher than 20 dB. Finally, we analyse the origin of error, and find purity and misalignments are the two main factors that would influence the performance of detection. Our results may be useful for high precision measurements of rotation speed in practical applications.",

Classical CMOS circuits, for which power consumption is always a big issue, find reversible solutions plausible due to their theoretical zero power dissipation [1].

This paper focuses on the application of reversible ideas to classical circuits by proposing the implementation of reversible logic circuits in CMOS technology for low power and high performance applications. In particular, we explore an application of an adiabatic logic circuit model to structuring reversible combinational and sequential CMOS gates, since in circuits realizing adiabatic concept, similarly to reversible logic, the power consumption is zero in ideal case.",

This parameter is very fluctuating. In fact, it depends on the wavelength of the beam, its power, its electric field vector but also it depends on the material itself (chemical composition, roughness, temperature). In that paper we have chosen to study the reflectivity and its changes because among all the thermo-physical quantities it plays a major role, and its influence echoes on the performance of cutting machines as well as on quality of final products. In this study we present the principles of an original device for measurement of reflectivity, device which works in situ conditions, therefore well adapted to the particular problem of laser cutting. Accurate values of reflectivity for various types of steels are determined using this device and will be given.",

The experimental results showed that one typical periodic submicron ripple, whose periodicity changed with scanning velocity, was obtained when the irradiating energy was lower than the critical damage laser energy value. Another typical multiscale complex structure consisted of micron protrusions, submicron dimples and submicron short ripples, which were obtained when the irradiating energy was higher than the critical damage laser energy value. Wettability experiments revealed that the apparent contact angles on the surfaces of original stainless steel sample, the periodic submicron ripples and the multi-scale textures were 114°, 148° and 162°, respectively. The results showed that two kinds of micro- and nano-scale surface textures on the stainless steel sample surface induced by the ultrafast laser radiation all had super-hydrophobic properties, with the multi-scale texture being more super-hydrophobic property than the periodic submicron rippled surface.",

By the sequence of experimental waveforms detected at different distances, the attenuation properties of shock waves are obtained.

With an increase in distance, the shock front rapidly detaches from the bubble wall, and the valley between the plasma shock wave and bubble wall become larger. Furthermore, the bubble collapse-induced shock wave is also gradually detached from the contracting bubble walls, and the interval between shock wave and bubble also becomes larger with increasing time.

The application reported in this work demonstrates how the process can be used to form recently developed high strength fibre metal laminate materials. These materials due to their construction and high strength are difficult to form once constructed using conventional techniques. Fibre metal laminates are of particular interest to the aerospace industry, where the high strength yet lightweight construction of parts made with these materials offers significant weight reductions and hence a reduction in operational costs of new large commercial aircraft such as the Airbus A380.

Then, based on the analysis results on the properties of the fracture splitting notch, qualitative analysis was carried out on the fracture surfaces. The experimental results showed that with appropriate processing parameters, an ideal fracture splitting notch could be obtained with a small bell mouth, a cylindrical central part, small root radius, high sharpness and moderate depth at the entrance. Also, laser grooving was found to be superior to the other possible processing methods like broaching, etc. for producing the fracture splitting notch. The area in the vicinity of the fracture splitting notch was divided into three parts: the melting zone; the solid-state phase transition zone and the base metal. The texture in the heat affected zone (HAZ) was refined significantly, with brittle martensite being largely generated to ensure the occurrence of a brittle fracture. Microhardness was measured to be as high as 790 HV, which is higher than the base metal and manifested as an obvious hardening effect as the type of fracture was found to be a brittle fracture.",

The effect of slot lip thickness and blowing ratios on film effectiveness under the two mainstream conditions were investigated. Based on heat and mass transfer analogy, the non-conductive pressure sensitive paint technique (PSP) was used to determine detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions.

Laser power, scanning angular velocity and defocusing were taken as independent variables. Based on the orthogonal experimental arrangement the data is optimized in multiple ways based on the grey relational analysis (GRA) system theoretical model. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and GRA are used to calculate the influence of degree single-objective and multi-objective optimization. The simulation results show that the influence of each parameter on welding quality is scanning angular velocity, defocus amount and laser power. The final optimized process parameter combination is a laser power of 1500 W, a scanning angular velocity of 18 rad/s and defocus of –10 mm. The experimental results show that the optimized parameters increase the welding depth by 2.5 mm compared with the original parameters, increased the weld seam hardness from 470 to 530 HV and produced welds with no pores, cracks, arc craters or other defects in the weld morphology. Also, there was a lot of martensite and retained austenite in the microstructure so the strength and formability of the welds are enhanced.

Secondly, the obtained curves are carried out standardization to convert them to the standard waveform according to their width and positions. Then all nodes in a certain area near the facula are used for iterative interpolation to position its centre. Finally, the experiment platform is built and the data of thirty different measured surfaces is obtained under the same experimental conditions.

The glass forming of the prepared samples was investigated by using XRD technique. The Archimedes’ method was used to determine the density of the prepared glass samples and the molar volume was calculated. The optical spectroscopic analysis of the prepared glass samples was carried out over the spectral range (190-2500 nm). The optical absorption and transmission spectra were recorded at room temperature using UV/VIS absorption (JASCO V570) spectrophotometer in the range of wavelength (190–2500) nm. The optical spectroscopic studies were performed over UV-visible- near IR spectral range in the wavelength interval of (190 – 2500 nm).The glass matrix shows a good transparency in both visible and near-IR spectrum ranges. At 2500 nm a considerably high transmission of about 78% is observed. The optical properties such as refractive index, dielectric constant, electric susceptibility and electronic polarizability of the prepared glass were evaluated. The results suggest the practicality of utilizing such new glass in the fabrication of optical supplies such as optical lenses. The metallization criteria data of the prepared glass show a good basis for predicting a particular nonlinear optical material.",

With decreasing size, the physical limits of conventional fabrication techniques such as photolithography and etching are encountered. Conventional NanoImprint templates are mainly focused on only high lateral resolution down to 5 nm [1]. Thus, three dimensional (3D) photonic nanostructures, requiring also precise vertical height-control, cannot be addressed on the basis of the conventional technology. In this paper, we present high vertical resolution 3D NanoImprint technologies and its applications concerning strongly miniaturized spectrometers (nanospectrometers) with optical resolution (λ/Δλ) up to 500. Our nanospectrometer consists of a 2D array of Fabry-Pérot (FP) filters, designed to match exactly to a 2D CCD detector array in lateral direction with a resulting system size of 2 × 2 × 4 mm3. The 3D filter cavities were imprinted using both 3D UV-NanoImprint (UV-NI) technology and Substrate Conformal Imprint Lithography (SCIL). For the deposition of Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs), Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) as well as Ion Beam Sputtering Deposition (IBSD) were applied. The filter arrays required for the spectrometer have been demonstrated to have an ultra-high transmittance > 80 % and a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of down to 1 nm.",

The coolant is a specially processed micro-particulate ice saline slurry, that can be easily pumped into a patient through surgical tubing, syringes, or minimally invasive surgical instruments. The device has exhibited three distinct ice production modes. During heterogeneous nucleation, the device begins continuous production of ice slurry that contains ~30% ice by mass within 10 minutes. The nominal ice particle diameter is smaller than 100 μm. This work represents a significant first step toward addressing clinical needs for rapid human cooling.",

People have been practicing social distancing by working from home in recent months since it is an excellent solution to reduce one’s exposure to COVID-19. However, many occupations do not have this chance due to the necessity to attend the workplace. Besides, some professions require close contact with infected people such as medicine and nursing, while others such as logging and gardening have a low level of risk in this respect. However, while occupations such as medicine and nursing can take precautions against the virus at a very good level, the knowledge of occupations such as logging and gardening is weak against it. Prioritizing occupations based on these conflicting criteria is an important task under the vagueness and impreciseness of human evaluations. In this paper, a novel fuzzy AHP & TOPSIS methodology is proposed, where the reliability and restriction of the expert assessments are considered by interval-valued type 2 fuzzy numbers. A real case study including five experts, 14 occupations, and seven criteria is presented. A comparative analysis is also given to validate the proposed methodology.",

Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is commonly used and well-accepted metric for TPM implementation in many manufacturing industries. As OEE is an important performance measure for effectiveness of any equipment, careful analysis is required to know the effect of various components. An attempt has been done in this research to predict the OEE by using simulation software. The objective is to identify an optimal OEE level to maximize the time between failures and simultaneously minimize the mean repair time. The process of OEE is optimized by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system (ANFIS) to identify optimized zone for maximizing output. Finally it is determined the feasible values of inputs using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm based on trained ANFIS predictive model. The result from this study can be used the inconvenient impact of the failures on the production process, it is strongly recommended to upgrade the operation management, i.e. TPM program, capacity analysis, parts replacement decisions, training programs for technicians/operators, spare parts requirement etc.",

The first instrument is a multi-functional biochip system called “OBMorph”, which is composed of an ellipsometric SPR with circular polarization interferometry which can be used to retrieve sensitive optical response on a surface. The OBMorph system enables us to control the incident angles easily with the paraboloidal mirrors to allow phase interrogation. Previous studies have shown that ellipsometric parameters can provide high resolutions up to 1 ng/ml for closed-channel IgG and Anti-IgG reaction measurements. Recently, we advanced the concept of an ITO-based chip by modifying the intrinsic ITO optical property by adopting an externally applied voltage which shifts the SPR angle for the required dynamic range by phase-interrogation. The refractive index of the ITO was analyzed for a change level at 10-4 while the externally applied DC voltage was set at under 100 mV. The second instrument we developed was a miniature handheld SPR device which has characteristics such as easy alignment, high sensitivity and low power consumption. Its advantages enable it to be used as a practical point-of-care-test (POCT) tool. The third instrument we developed was a dual-channel radially polarized surface plasmon microscope (SPM) system which offers high sensitivity for single nanoparticle detecting measurements. The complementary fluorescent image and the back-scattered image from the nanoparticle were found to be well co-localized.",

It can be used to design an N-bit constant-time adder with a 227-ps delay and a power consumption of 33 µW per digit at 2-GHz clock frequency. The 64-bit version exhibits higher performance than a state-of-the-art fully optimized 64-bit carry-select adder implemented on the same technology.",

Laser cladding, which can enhance the mechanical properties of the rail by creating a coating, has been received great attention on the area of the rails due to the attractive advantages such as low inputted heat, small heat affected zone (HAZ), small deformation, etc. In this paper, based on the relationship between the hardness and wear rate, effects of materials and the damage behaviour, recent developments in wear and RCF are reviewed.

    "abstract": "Now days low power devices are getting more attention in electronics field so recent year designers have designed devices in a way that they consumes less power but obstacles are in maintaining parameter like area, total power and leakage power to achieve system goal. VLSI technology has got enormous in last few years and chip size is scaling down rapidly whose result is that density and complexity of chip has been increased rapidly. The first aim of designer is to design low power devices that fulfill the requirements of the systems. Leakage power is attentive parameter to design low power devices because it plays a major role to increase the total power consumption of the devices. Self-controllable voltage level (SVL) is power switch technique for leakage reduction in the device. It reduces the leakage power because SVL can assert maximum supply voltage in active mode and decrease the supply voltage in stand-by mode. Designing and calculation of parameters of FinFET based Priority Encoder using SVL technique has been done in 45 nm technology with different operating voltage 0.3V, 0.5V, and 0.7V and that was done with cadence virtuoso tool.",

The IN718 components often have complex shapes that are difficult to manufacture using conventional machining. Recently there is a growing interest in additive manufacturing (AM) practically laser metal deposition (LMD) due to its ability to manufacture three-dimensional (3-D) complex products from Inconel 718; however, the LMD products suffer from defects such as cracks, porosity and lack of adhesion due to using low-quality powder and/ or improper processing parameters. This study focuses on the deposition of Inconel 718 on 304 stainless steel substrates at low heat input, aiming to obtain cracks free products. The effect of specific energy, laser interaction time and powder mass flow rate on the characteristics of the deposited layers such as surface roughness, layer height, dilution, microstructure, and hardness were investigated. The results showed that all specimens are crack-free at all levels of experiments, few pores were observed in some specimens; however, the using of low heat input comes at the expense of low layers height.",

An analytical solution for temperature distribution in the assembly was obtained for a step input heating pulse at the coating surface. Since the coating thickness is considerably smaller than the thickness of the base-substrate, an effective boundary condition was introduced through two approaches in order to resemble the coating at the base-substrate surface. The effective boundary condition simplified the analysis and minimized the mathematical complications at the coating and base-substrate interface. The resulting analytical solution was simulated to obtain temperature variation at the coating and base-substrate interface for a Ni coating at differing thicknesses. The simulation was extended to include the effects of the coating material and the heat source pulse length on the temperature distribution. It was found that both approaches of effective boundary conditions gave identical temperature distributions at the coating and base-substrate interface. The rise and fall in temperature at the interface was faster in the early heating and early cooling periods, respectively. This became more pronounced for short pulse lengths.",

With simple optical arrangement and easy operation, the method can be applied to real-time, online measurements. The transmission signal with fluctuations are analysed by using 1st order band-pass filters, and the experimental data in the frequency domain are obtained. The PSD and concentrations are extracted from the experimental data with the modified Chahine interactions. In this part, we presents a study on the TFS measurements in which the particle concentration varies in a very wide dynamic range.

QMDDs are of the form of a rooted, directed, acyclic graph with initial and terminal vertices where each vertex is annotated with a variable name representing a circuit line. Directed paths from the initial to a terminal vertex can be represented as a sequence of variable names in the order in which they appear in the path. The existence of QMDD paths that do not contain all variable names, or “skipped variables”, has direct ramifications in the formulation of synthesis and other algorithms for reversible and quantum logic. Skipped variables are generally rare and tend to appear in quantum circuits that are intended to operate using superimposed values on the control lines. We have found that a unitary matrix representing a circuit whose QMDD contains skipped variables is likely to exhibit a specific anomaly when decomposed into a cascade of unitary matrices using the Reck-Zeilinger-Bernstein-Bertani algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, new forms of ordinary fuzzy sets have been introduced. Developed forms of fuzzy sets aim to identify the uncertainty thoroughly and get better maximizing outcomes. Fermatean fuzzy sets are one of the newly developed forms of ordinary fuzzy sets that identify the uncertainty comprehensively. Decision-making process uses some mathematical methods and methodologies providing experts to make the correct decision. One of these methods, the MABAC method, is based on computing the distance between each alternative and the bored approximation area. However, decision-making processes also involves ambiguity and vagueness that the fuzzy sets and fuzzy decision-making strategies can easily manage while crisp methods may not. Therefore, we aimed to propose a novel method based on MABAC method with Fermantean fuzzy sets. To achieve this aim, we briefly reviewed basic theories of Fermantean fuzzy sets. Moreover, Fermantean fuzzy MABAC method was constructed, and the steps of the decision-making process were clarified. An illustrative example is given to show the applicability of the proposed method. Additionally, comparative analyses and sensitivity analysis were conducted. As a result, we demonstrate that our model can handle the decision-making process effectively and efficiently.",

Microaneurysms and Hemorrhages are the foremost progressive symptoms of DR termed as red lesions which have greater potential of causing vision impairment. Timely investigation of digital fundus photographs collected from fundus camera helps in earlier detection of DR. Various techniques related to conventional methods have been used by researchers in the past time which involves manual feature extraction-based learning. Existing deep learn- ing techniques like Convolutional Neural Network, customized neural networks incur cost due to huge computation and complex architecture. In this work, auto-encoder based framework for DR classification is designed to achieve optimal network structure with minimum computation thereby saving the training time. The proposed model namely Genetic algorithm based Stacked Sparse Auto Encoder (GA-SSAE) involves feature extraction using two layers namely Init and Elite layer integrated with genetic algorithm (GA) and softmax classifier. The layers are trained and fine-tuned in a supervised manner using Truncated Newton Constrained optimization (TNC) method to fetch optimal weights. GA-SSAE model has been tested on the standard datasets namely Messidor, ROC and also on the real-world images. Experimental results show that the GA-SSAE model well suits the ROC and Lotus dataset with an accuracy of 98% and 95% respectively.",

The main idea of this paper is to coordinate their conflicts using fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. Weights are assigned to each behavior using fuzzy logic (14 rules are used for assigning weights) and then weighted average of crisp values is taken to produce final output. The robot is modelled in Matlab and the fuzzy logic rules are optimized for the best results possible.

Single clad deposition of E501T-1 low alloy steel filler wire was made on 4 mm thick Q235 carbon steel substrate using a large-sized spot high power diode laser (HPDL) laser. The typical position relationships of the laser beam and the filler wire were calibrated by mathematical calculation firstly. Then the process maps indicating the melting mechanics of filler wire and the stable cladding process at different cladding conditions were developed. Lastly, based on the high speed camera system, the relationships between the melting and transfer behaviours of filler wire and the formation of deposition layer were revealed. The results showed that there were two typical melting mechanisms of filler wire. And the transfer behaviours of liquid metal could be decomposed into large droplet transfer, liquid-bridge transfer, and spreading transfer mode. The stable cladding process and well-formed deposition layer could be obtained while liquid metal was transferred into the molten pool with a liquid-bridge. Comparing with other laser-wire positions, the laser energy and filler wire interacted with each other more sufficiently and the liquid bridge transfer mode could be formed in a larger process window while the filler wire was partially covered by the laser beam. The most ideal distance between the laser beam and filler wire was zero.",

The C=C stretching mode in the ground state starts to oscillate p-out-of-phase with the CºC stretching mode. The structure of PDA-3BCMU in the geometrically relaxed state is not pure butatriene-type but more like acetylene-type. The frequencies of C=C and CºC stretching modes there were determined by singular value decomposition method to be 1472 ± 6 cm-1 and 2092 ± 6 cm-1, respectively. The double and triple bond stretching frequencies in the ground state were deter-mined to be 1463 ± 6 cm-1 and 2083 ± 6 cm-1, respectively.",

A wide range of variation in the electronic and optical properties can be achieved through changes in the polymer structures. The underlying photophysics results from delocalized electrons along the main polymer chain and the nature of localization is controlled in principle by electronic structural changes in conjunction with conformational changes by, e.g., chemical substitution, doping and interchain interactions. We review these basic ideas and present results of a comprehensive effort developing polythiophenes, a well-studied member of the class of one class of pseudo-one-dimensional conjugated polymers. The value of polythiophenes in photonic applications is based on what is perhaps the most important structure-property relationship in conjugated polymers, which is the chemical stability and processibility as a function of the molecular structure.",

Susceptibility of cracking of coatings is mainly determined by the stresses developing during the solidification of molten coatings and substrate. Residual stress of the deposited layer is crucial to the operating life span and safety of the remanufactured, repaired, or fabricated components by laser cladding. In this work, AISI316L stainless steel powders were cladded on AISI321 stainless steel substrate using laser cladding technique. Pre- and post-clad heat treatments, using laser beam, were applied on the substrate and individual tracks, respectively. The effects of lead time (time interval between pre-clad heat treatment and cladding) and delay time (time interval between cladding and post-clad heat treatment) on the residual stress of coatings surface were investigated. It was found that the effects of lead time for pre-clad heating and delay time for post-clad heating on residual stress are significant and there exist specific values of lead time and delay time for which residual stress of coatings surface is minimal.",

In the literature so far on the vague set, system reliability is evaluated using a fuzzy arithmetic operation on the collected imprecise, vague or uncertain data. This may contain the wide spread of the reliability and hence cannot give a right decision to decision makers. So in order to remove the uncertainty up to the desired degree, an attempt has been made in this paper in which an expression of system reliability is evaluated using ordinary arithmetic operations instead of fuzzy arithmetic operation and particle swarm optimization has been used to construct their membership functions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with analyze of the fuzzy reliability of series, parallel and series-parallel systems using different types of intuitionistic fuzzy failure rates. The computed results from the analysis have a less range of uncertainty as the comparability of existing results.",

To multiplex control signals enables to overlap a request signal and an acknowledge signal. Therefore, simultaneous control of handshaking that the request signal and the acknowledge signal are sent at the same time is allowed, which leads that the cycle time of the asynchronous data transfer can be greatly reduced. Since the use of the proposed 2-color 1-phase dual-rail encoding method can detect the present signal state by observing the sum of their dual-rail codes, it is possible to control asynchronous operation correctly. The hardware for the proposed asynchronous data transfer is simply implemented by using multiple-valued current-mode logic circuits, because linear summation is realized by wiring without any active devices. It is demonstrated with a 0.18mm CMOS technology that the communication speed of the proposed hardware becomes about twice as fast as that of a corresponding CMOS circuit with a conventional protocol under the same power dissipation.",

This study contributes to the understanding of communication between brain areas by analyzing the methods that reveal cerebral interactions and brain influences using data from Event-Related Potentials (ERP), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF). To investigate effective connectivity in the brain, the autoregressive time variant (tvAR) models are used. The investigation of the effective connectivity included the analyses by means of time variant Granger Causality Index, of time variant Partial Directed Coherence, and of partial correlation. The second objective of the study was the application of the methods to composed physiological data. The methods are applied to examine change in the physiological control system, by extracting the directed connections between the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory signal.",

So far, a variety of analyzes and detections have been made to detect such malware. While detecting malware, good results have been obtained with various methods, but malicious people have developed methods of hiding themselves against these methods. We propose a new feature selection method based on Firefly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) with the Fuzzy Set-Based (FSB) weighting method. The proposed method performs better than traditional feature selection methods with fewer features. The experimental results of this study proved that FOA is an acceptable optimization algorithm for feature selection to detect malware in terms of classification performance and classification runtime. In addition, experimental evaluation of TFIDF and FSB weighting methods indicates the effectiveness of the FSB weighting with a full feature set.",

In addition, the topological entropy of rule 56 is calculated on its subsystems and the global attractor of rule 56 is characterized. Meanwhile, the isles of Eden of rule 56 are explored for some finite length of binary strings, which reveal its Bernoulli characteristics.

Unfortunately, as grinding is considered to be highly complex, non-stationary and dependent on a large number of input variables, the monitoring of surface burn in grinding process is thus necessary yet difficult. In this work a surface burn production method using high energy density pulsed laser was introduced. Controlled surface burn on various metals was obtained by adjusting laser pulse duration and pulse frequency. Acoustic emission was used for in-process surface burn monitoring. Factors such as laser pulse duration, pulse frequency and sensor mounting location which influence acoustic emission features were also studied. Frequency spectra with and without surface burn were compared. The differences were distinct. It was also found that root mean square (RMS) and mean energy of acoustic emission could successfully reflect the occurrence of surface burn. Findings in this work could provide knowledge for further surface burn monitoring in grinding.",

The feasibility study of both techniques in modeling the planer structures under study reveals that ANFIS is more accurate in predicting the characteristic parameters of both structures.

More recently, two-photon excitation found important applications in biology, notably in two-photon excited microscopy (TPEM) or two-photon photodynamic therapy (2P-PDT). Nevertheless, these techniques were using dyes or sensitizers designed for one-photon processes with low two-photon response. The lack of efficient molecules specifically designed for two-photon applications has led us to design new chromophores for biological applications with increased sensitivity to two-photon excitation and specifically added properties useful in biological media, such as water solubility. Here we describe the molecular engineering of such dyes mainly for cell and small animal observation by TPEM and their conjugation to magnetic nanoparticles and bio-nanoparticles such as viruses.We will then focus on the possibility to use photochemical reaction for cell triggering by two-photon photorelease of biologically active substances the so-called two-photon uncaging.",

    "abstract": "A laser line welder that uses a Yb:YAG disk laser was manufactured and applied to produce ultra-thin coils by continuous operation in a cold-rolling mill. The coils welded range from 0.15 to 0.30 mm in thickness and from 800 to 1100 mm in width. Because the strip is very thin compared to its width, the laser line welding is likely to cause defects such as pinholes on the weld bead. Depending on the diameter of pinholes, the hole-shaped defects on the seam can significantly reduce weld quality including tensile strength and bending strength. To prevent generation of such defects, a hydraulic control device is integrated into the laser line welder so that the positions for cutting and welding by laser are placed with ±30 μm of the target; furthermore, to avoid weld failure, a vision system has been optimized for real-time inspection of the weld zone and detection of weld defects both before and after welding.",

The previous researches have shown that the classifiers learned by GP have high precision in many application domains. However, nominal data cannot be handled and calculated by the model of using discriminant functions. In this paper, we present a scheme based on rough set theory and genetic programming to learn discriminant functions from general data containing both nominal and numerical attributes. The proposed scheme first transforms the nominal data into numerical values by applying the technique of rough sets. Then, genetic programming is used to learn discriminant functions. The conflict problem among discriminant functions is solved by an effective conflict resolution method based on the distance-based fitness function. The experimental results show that the classifiers generated by the proposed scheme using GP are effective on nominal data in comparison with C4.5, CBA, and NB-based classifiers.",

    "abstract": "For airborne LiDAR technology, attitude fluctuations of airborne platform can significantly influence the accuracy of the obtained point cloud products. In order to quantitatively evaluate the influencing size of the platform attitude fluctuations, so as to find out appropriate method to eliminate this un-favourite impact, we analysed the influencing mechanism of the platform attitude fluctuations on the accuracy of the reconstructed digital surface model (DSM) based on the two-dimensional (2-D) Whittaker-Shannon Sampling Theorem firstly. Next, through numerical simulation, the influencing characteristics of the platform attitude fluctuations on the point density distribution of the laser point cloud were studied. Finally, a semi-physical simulation system was built to simulate the working procedure of airborne LiDAR under the influence of platform attitude fluctuations, and the impact of the platform attitude fluctuations on the area of coverage and point density of the laser point cloud was validated. The obtained laser point cloud was used to reconstruct a DSM based on the triangular irregular network (TIN) model, and the distortion of the reconstructed TIN-based DSM caused by the platform attitude fluctuations was quantitatively evaluated. Experiment results show that, when the airborne platform has an attitude fluctuation of sinusoidal movement with the amplitude of 3.0º and the frequency of 0.5 Hz, the elevation error of the reconstructed DSM has an increase of 0.062% of the flight height above ground level, corresponding to the increase of elevation error of 31.1 cm for the DSM at the actual flight height of 500.00 m, which means that the platform attitude fluctuations is a much significant factor for deteriorating the accuracy of the reconstructed DSM; therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent from the attitude fluctuations. Future research will focus on the compensation of platform attitude fluctuations for airborne LiDAR.",

An important feature of EGG is its capability to optimize general graph structures directly instead of encoding the structures into indirect representations, such as bit strings and trees. The EGG system can be applied to various circuit optimization problems at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential capability of EGG in designing multiple-valued logic circuits with different levels of abstraction. In general, the practical design of multiple-valued logic circuits can be divided into (i) the gate-level logic design using primitive logic gates whose functions are defined by logical expressions and (ii) the transistor-level precise circuit design of each primitive logic gate realizing analog transfer characteristics. Design examples discussed in this paper include (i) the gate-level design of multiple-valued current-mode logic circuits for redundant arithmetic and (ii) the transistor-level design of high-performance current mirrors to be used as basic components in current-mode logic.",

This paper evaluates a soft-delay-error (SDE) effect due to particle strike for soft-error tolerant content-addressable memories (CAMs). The SDE is that a particle strike into semiconductor materials induces a transient pulse signal, causing a delay variation and a timing error of an integrated circuit. The delay variation is evaluated using a charge-injection model at a transistor level for two different CAMs. One of the CAMs is a traditional 9-transistor-cell based CAM and the other is a magnetic-tunnel-junction (MTJ)/MOS hybrid cell based CAM that operates based on a multiple-valued current-mode logic. These two CAMs are simulated using a SPICE simulator that can handle both transistors and MTJ devices in a 90nm CMOS/100nm MTJ technology. Based on the simulation results, circuit architectures and design parameters are discussed in order to design soft-error tolerant CAMs.",

Surface pressure (p) versus surface area (A) isotherm data for these polymers show several steps and plateaus and this had been assumed to indicate the formation of multilayers with distinct layer thickness consisting of 1, 2, 3, etc. (up to seven) layers. For the Langmuir monolayers (LM’s) and multilayers the observed single GIXD peak allowed to estimate: i) the inter-chain distance in planes, ii) the extent of the lateral positional correlation between parallel chains, iii) the thickness of the multilayers and separate monolayers. The results obtained with XR reveal that the multilayers have a very uniform layer thickness and that there is a significant degree of structural order in the packing of these polymers in the multilayers in a direction perpendicular to the polymer axis, i.e. two-dimensional structural order (in and out of plane). SFM performed on the Langmuir monolayers and bi-layers transferred to solid supports showed relatively homogeneous covering. Some possible application of the multi-layers is discussed.",

The use of different strategies for enhancing the TPA cross section is exemplified by resorting to some recent results of collaborative research work carried out in our laboratory.",

It is reasoned that codes are important for leakage squeezing. But it is necessary to have certain cryptographic properties in leakage squeezing functions as argued in this paper. In this paper we analyze certain Cellular Automata (CA) configurations towards leakage squeezing.We show that certain nonlinear CA configurations have those cryptographic properties and thus are suitable in leakage squeezing applications. We also propose a new leakage squeezing scheme that uses encryption. This encryption based leakage squeezing generates masks using some symmetric key encryption process. It is demonstrated in this paper as well that scan attack on AES can be resisted using leakage squeezing.",

The points whose elevation values are lower than the threshold are classified as ground points.

Due to presence of gaussian beam, there is redistribution of carriers from high field region to low field region by ponderomotive force, as a result of which a transverse density gradient is produced in the plasma. This transverse density gradient in turn generates an electron plasma wave at pump wave frequency. The electron plasma wave so generated interacts with the pump beam to produce second harmonics. The differential equation governing the evolution of spot size of laser beam has been derived by following Wentzel Kramers Brillouin(W.K.B) approximation and paraxial theory approach and has been solved numerically to investigate the effect of laser intensity, plasma density, laser spot size and plasma temperature on self-focusing of the laser beam and second harmonic yield.",

The analysis applies a combined Monte Carlo/Finite Element model to calculate transient fields of temperature, critical current densities and stability functions under single, isolated disturbances that could interrupt zero loss current transport and lead to a quench. The Monte Carlo/Finite element method is applied to a 1G filament, high temperature superconductor. Results obtained for maximum, zero loss current transport in the filament are different up to 30% from solutions achieved with standard, solely solid conduction heat transfer. Release of mechanical strain energy or of impinging particle radiation are taken as examples for single, isolated point-like disturbances.

Multiple layers can be saved to form shapes with complex geometry. This manufacturing procedure has been utilized for modifying the material surface property and for the repair of the component. There are many parameters which have influence on controlling the characteristics of laser hardfaced surfaces and one such parameter is powder feed rate. In this investigation the effect of powder feed rate on microstructure, microhardness and wear resistance of laser hardfacing Ni-based Colmonoy-5 alloy (Ni-Cr-Si-B-C) powder onto a 316LN austenitic stainless steel substrate was analysed. The powder feed rate was varied from 3 to 11 g/min. The other parameters such as laser power, travel speed and defocusing distance were kept constant. From this investigation, it was found that the deposit hardness increased from 500 to 800 HV with increase in powder feed rate. The microstructure of the hardfaced deposit primarily consists of the γ-Ni phase and the interdendritic eutectic mixture comprises γ-nickel, nickel-rich borides and chromium-rich carbides. These contribute to higher hardness in deposits at higher powder feed rate.",

Generally, researchers use a single microphone to collect the acoustic signals. Owing to interference in a noisy working environment, the quality of an acoustic signal acquired by a single microphone is not good. This limits the use of an acoustic signal to detect weld quality in industry applications. In this paper, microphone array technology is adopted and an independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm is proposed. Welding experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility of proposed ICA method. To identify the extracted signals, a number of signal processing techniques, including frequency-domain and time–frequency analyses, were employed to analyse extracted signal components. The results show that typical welding defects can be identified using the proposed ICA method in noisy environments.",

Chiral photonics is a new direction for photonics that encompasses enantio-selective polarization control of linear and nonlinear optical functions. New materials are required to realize the full potential of this field. Specifically, chiral polymers or polymer nanocomposites exhibiting very large optical rotation and third-order optical nonlinearity are needed to make applications of chiral photonics a reality. Multiscale modeling, guiding the synthesis of materials and nanocomposites with custom-tailored photonic functionality, is a necessary strategy. This review describes the necessary multiscale modeling and provides an example of modeling guided synthesis. Characterization methods are also described, together with some demonstrative results. These novel materials would have a broad and transformative impact in many technological areas by enabling on-demand roll-to-roll fabrication of flexible chiral photonic polymer based-materials with unprecedented throughput and manufacturing efficiency.",

While laminar flow does not redistribute the momentum of the oscillations, turbulent flow does redistribute the momentum of the flow and, as a result, dominates the damping. As a result, it is important to understand the internal flow behavior and the factors that affect the flow during these experiments.

Since fluorophores used in epi-fluorescence or confocal microscopy have limited sensitivity in TPEM in biological media, chemists and biologists attempt to design new fluorochromes for this application. Here the engineering of dyes for the specific detection of DNA and RNA molecules is a great challenge. We describe here the conception, preparation, and characterization of new two-photon-sensitive fluorochromes that are derived from cyanine and malachite green dyes and are specific for the detection of DNA and RNA respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes applications of a code-division multiple access (CDMA) technique to efficient data transmission for new-paradigm VLSI systems. A pseudo-random orthogonal m-sequence carrier is employed as a multiplexable information carrier to realize efficient data transmission. Using orthogonal property of m-sequences, it is possible to multiplex several computational activities into a single circuit, and execute in parallel using multiplexed data transmission with reduced interconnection. Also, randomness of m-sequences offers the high tolerance to interference, and suppression of dynamic range of signals. In order to introduce a CDMA technique to “wired” intra/inter-chip communication, we develop multiple-valued m-sequences, an equalization technique and compact current-mode MOS circuits. The Spice and MATLAB simulation results of MV-CDMA systems demonstrate the excellent capabilities of eliminating co-channel interference inherent in wired-CDMA systems.",

The measured current gives information on the quantity of charge flowing through the thin film volume. Additionally, charge drift mobility was measured, its character was determined and molecular dynamics simulations were performed. In the simulations the participation of crystalline and amorphous phases were taken into account, as well as a transition phase at the crystal–amorphous phase boundary. The obtained results were compared with the experimental data. The DC conductivity activation energy value was found to be in the range of 0.008–1.0 eV.

The polarizability and first order hyperpolarizability of the title molecule were calculated and interpreted on the finite field approach to reveal the nonlinear optical property of the chosen crystal T5SS. The calculated first order hyperpolarizability (β) of T5SS is found to be 3.267 times that of urea which suggests that the material may be a suitable candidate for nonlinear optical applications. The Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis confirms the occurrences of strong inter and intramolecular charge transfer or conjugative interaction in the molecule which enhance the increase in hyperpolarizability (β) value. Frontier molecular orbital analysis explains the eventual charge transfer occurrence between the molecules and the energy gap reflects the chemical reactivity of the molecule. The percentage of intermolecular contacts contributing to the Hirshfeld surface in T5SS crystal was obtained by Hirshfeld surface analyses with 2D fingerprint plots.",

They were superimposed on the thermally activated mobility growth according to the Poole-Frenkel or Gaussian disorder models. The peaks could be attributed to the carrier generation from the oxygen-related traps with activation energies 0.45–0.55 eV, 0.76–0.8 eV, and 0.76–0.9 eV. In contrast the traps could not be recharged by electric field, which resulted in a sample polarization instead. The non-exponential depolarization lasted for several thousands seconds and was not thermally activated even above the glass transition temperature, pointing out to different physico-chemical mechanisms, e.g., reversible chemical reactions or chain structure reorganization.",

Small deviations in the structural features of the particles result in large changes in the nonlinear response.

Recent achievements in sample fabrication make it possible to obtain metal nanostructures with very high quality and tailorable nonlinear optical properties. Our study shows that the nonlinear optical response of high-quality samples is driven by electric-dipole interactions and is no longer uncontrollable as it was in the past for low-quality samples. Improving sample quality has also made it possible to observe the effect of higher-order resonances on the nonlinear response.",

We present our efforts on enhancing the damage threshold through nonlinear scattering so that these materials can be used efficiently even at high input fluences.

    "abstract": "It was a very good idea to promote blue jeans with a faded and torn look, which was a way of expressing poverty to catch the eye. Thus, jean manufacturers started fading and tearing. Faded blue jeans which looked strikingly poor and particularly those with torn legs and bare knees became very popular in a short time amongst young customers. They were even sold at a higher price in certain areas than bright blue jeans which looked brand new. Companies have been trying in recent years to develop various techniques to improve the visual aspects of denim fabrics. These techniques mainly include printing on fabrics, embroidery and washing the final product. Especially, fraying certain areas of the fabric by sanding and stone washing to create designs is a popular technique. However, due to certain disadvantages of these processes and in response to a rapidly growing demand, research is underway to obtain a similar appearance by creating better quality under more advantageous manufacturing conditions. Developing new designs by using the computer and transferring the designs which are obtained to textile surfaces will not only increase and facilitate the production in a practical manner, but also help to create identical designs. This implies mass production of products of the same quality and increasing their profit. Moreover, creating textile designs using a laser will also contribute to the value of the product as far as the consumer is concerned because it will not cause any wear and deformation in the texture of the fabric unlike sanding and stoning processes. In this study, the first step was to prepare 40 pairs of denim samples, half of which were prepared manually and the other half by using a laser. Time studies were made at every stage of production for laser beam ‘designing’ and manual ‘designing’ and the two were compared to determine the differences between the two methods.",

These networks face different challenges from their terrestrial version, such as high communication delay, restricted amount of energy and high energy consumption. Topology control solutions can be beneficial to these networks since they can, among other things, save nodes energy and thus improve network lifetime. In this work, we present topology control in underwater wireless sensor networks through the use of cellular automata. We designed three solutions (TCA, TCA-F, and TCA-R) that use the concepts of cellular automata to control the topology of a network. Simulations show that the solutions are able to extend the lifetime of a network while ensuring a proper space coverage over the time. They also show how the choice of values for the parameters of each solution affects their performance.",

In order to ensure the optimal exploitation of renewable energy sources, selection of appropriate renewable energy technologies with a thorough assessment approach is required. There are several conversion technologies for biomass, which constitutes an important part of renewable energy sources. The evaluation of biomass conversion technologies is a complex problem since it contains many criteria, some of which are contradictory and must be taken into account simultaneously. Axiomatic design outperforms other design techniques by considering both what decision makers want to achieve and what the system can provide as Pythagorean fuzzy sets provide a greater domain to experts while assigning membership and non-membership values in a decision making process. Therefore, in this study, Pythagorean fuzzy sets are combined with axiomatic design approach to evaluate biomass conversion technologies. It is revealed that combustion is the best biomass conversion technology for the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. The sensitivity and comparative analyses are conducted to show robustness and reliability of the results.",

We show that a continuous decrease of the probability of excitation of cells triggers a drastic change of behaviour, driving the system from an “active” to an “extinct” steady state. Simulations show that this phenomenon is a nonequilibrium phase transition that belongs to directed percolation universality class. Observations show an amazing robustness of the critical behaviour with regard to topological perturbations: not only is the phase transition occurrence preserved, but its universality class remains directed percolation. We also demonstrate that the position of the critical threshold can be easily predicted as it decreases linearly with the inverse of the average number of neighbours per cell.",

Computation in ACAs usually requires some special mechanism to control the unpredictable transitions of cells, which in turn causes the increase in the complexity of ACAs as compared to their synchronous counterpart. Nevertheless, inclusion of fluctuation into ACAs promises models with less complexity, e.g., the Brownian cellular automaton (Lee and Peper, 2008) which uses three cell states and three kinds of transition rules to conduct universal computation. By taking this approach one step further, we propose a novel cellular automaton in which local configurations representing signals will propagate randomly in the cellular space, as if they were subject to Brownian motion. Depending on merely two cell states and two kinds of transition rules, our new ACA can be used to construct any arbitrary asynchronous circuit in the cellular space, and hence, it is computationally universal. The reduced complexity of the new ACA may offer possibility of simple physical realizations.",

The characteristics of the Z-scan technique using the LG beams was analysed and the peak and valley of the on-axis normalized transmittance was seen to decrease with increasing radial modes, p, for angular mode m = 0, but increase with increasing radial modes for other angular modes. When the medium thickness increased the peak and the valley of the normalized transmittance initially increased linearly and then began to saturate when the thickness exceeded the threshold.",

The melt surface speed in the direction of the assisting gas flow and melt depth are formulated in terms of the laser output power and the rate of the assisting gas at the edge of the boundary layer. It was found that increasing the laser power level enhances the thickness of the liquid layer whereas the high speed of the assisting gas decreases the thickness of the liquid layer due to large magnitude of the dragging force developed at the assisting gas-liquid interface (melt surface). Increasing the speed of the assisting gas at the edge of the boundary layer increases the speed of the liquid layer on the melted surface. The thermal efficiency is improved significantly as the laser power levels increase; in this case, the rate of convection and conduction heat transfer from the melt layer is less than that compared with the laser power available at the melt surface.",

Leakage control techniques are applied at circuit level as well as at architectural level. Multi threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) is used at circuit level in Integrated Circuits (IC’s) to reduce the leakage power by shutting off currents to logic blocks that are not in use. Resistance offered by high threshold voltage (Vth) sleep transistor during active mode should be small enough. The total standby leakage in the chip is proportional to width of sleep transistor and other related dimensions. Optimal sizing of sleep transistors is difficult. MTCMOS circuits suffer from drawbacks like long wakeup latency, large amount of rush-through current and wasteful energy usage during mode transition from standby to active and vice versa. An energy-efficient high-speed low power low Vth CMOS logic is proposed for designing low power circuits. The scheme is implemented using Mentor Graphics’s tools followed by comparison with the already existing leakage control techniques.",

A chemical medium in sub-excitable, excitable or self-exciting (oscillating) regimes supports propagating excitation pulses. These pulses can be used for information coding and processing. In the manuscript we review models that can be applied to describe the time evolution of a medium composed of droplets: we discuss a homogeneous differential equation model, a spatially extended partial differential equation model and a cellular automaton model of the chemical reaction. Furthermore, we propose a new high level modelling approach for the droplets, that discretises the chemical states and considers stochasticity in the transition functions. We demonstrate how the values of experimentally measured quantities like oscillation periods, diffusion coefficients and wave propagation speeds can be deduced from the lower level models. Furthermore we offer an outlook on the currently ongoing work and the role of the different modelling and simulation scopes within.",

The results showed that the columnar grains with a mean size of 0.8 μm, which grew epitaxially perpendicular to the boundary of the meltpool, dominated the microstructure in the meltpool. The inside of the overlapping area was mainly cellular dendrites, with an average diameter of 1.5 μm and different orientations. The finer fibrous eutectic Si phase was well distributed in the meltpool, the microhardness was 5.2% higher than that in the overlapping area, and the track-track overlapping area was the main area that gave rise to the formation of initial cracks when the sample was compressed. The reason for this phenomenon is that in the meltpool, the fibrous eutectic Si phase is finely dispersed, and the grain size is small, resulting in greater hardness than in the overlapping area. In the overlapping area, the distribution of the Si phase was heterogeneous, and the grain orientation was different in the adjacent region. When compression was applied, the force could not be uniformly dispersed, and this resulted in cracks. The loading direction of the force was perpendicular to the growth direction, and the slip surface direction of the overlapping area was parallel to the direction of the applied force; therefore, the crack initiation occurred mainly in the track-track overlapping area.",

It may be the case that we have only chances for a unique experiment or no similar experiences are available, but it may be also the case that no standard experiment allows the observation of such a good behavior, simply because such good behavior can not be properly defined, in terms of standard crisp experiments. This situation is quite often associated to complex decision making problems. Then the only support we can find for our decision is the decision process itself, i.e., the consistency of the arguments leading to such a decision. Checking the quality of such a procedure becomes in this framework a key issue. Since specification is being quite often poorly defined, we postulate that the design and formal specification of algorithms and processes require a fuzzy approach.",

This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study to develop a gas-solid two phase stream powder injection model for laser welding with filler powder. The model was compared to the shape of the powder injection stream that was experimentally measured from images; the simulation results are in excellent agreement with the experimental ones. The results show that the tangent of the injection angle of the powder nozzle is linearly correlated with the focal length of the powder stream. When the flow rates of the carrier gas and shielding gas were both 8 l/min and the injection angle of the powder nozzle was 70°, a powder stream spot size that matches the width of the welding pool and excellent powder stream focus can be obtained. Experiments of laser welding with coaxial filler powder show that excellent laser-powder coupling can improve the quality of the laser weld. The investigation of the powder stream provides a basis for the development of coaxial powder injection and high-quality laser welding with filler powder.",

    "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a respiratory disorder that affects a very significant number of patients of different ages. One of the main consequences of suffering apnea is a higher likelihood of stroke onset. Sleep apnea is identified as alterations to the breathing rate of the individual while asleep, due to obstruction of the respiratory tract. These alterations produce abnormal chest movements that can be measured by using accelerometers. In recent studies, the use of simple heuristics to determine the time between inhalation and exhalation has been reported using preset thresholds to determine inhalation/exhalation events. In this study, two different approaches based on SAX Time Series representation are proposed. The first approach identifies the time intervals between respiratory events, while the second approach compiles a dictionary of normal movements while asleep. A dictionary is created for each independent posture. Abnormal movements are detected by means of the SAX distances between the shortened words. Experiments are based on the same realistic data set taken from previous studies in the literature. The results show that the small windows-based detection algorithm could be a suitable approach for simplifying the implementation and the scalability of apnea problems. Further work is needed for accurate automated setting of the thresholds.",

Near infrared (NIR), which is heavily used for this purpose, suffers due to cost, low absorption in biological chromospheres, and stratum corneum, and accuracy. One of the candidates that has not been widely investigated for BGD is visible laser light. Compared to NIR, the refractive index of red laser light is more sensitive to the variations in glucose level concentration resulting in faster response times. Red laser light also demonstrates both higher linearity and accuracy for BGD. On the other hand, a visible laser source is essential to realize low-cost sensor devices. The difficulty in using red laser for BGD is its low penetration depth. Long range surface plasmon resonance (LRSPR) can considerably improve the penetration depth. In this paper we designed and simulated with finite difference time domain (FDTD) a fingertip touch based non-invasive glucose sensor with LRSPR using a visible laser diode (LD) in an insulator-metal-insulator (IMI) structure coated onto a glass prism employing the matrix method.

A form of UVC is presented called Pulsed Melodic Affective Processing, which utilizes melodies to perform affective computations.

Herein a fuzzy logic expert system-based intelligent model for predicting tensile shear strength in laser joining between 304 stainless steel and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) printed by fused deposition modelling (FDM) was developed. The fuzzy logic was performed using fuzzy toolbox in MATLAB software by employing Mamdani method. Three linguistic values have been assigned namely low, medium and high for laser power and joining speed. For three-dimensional (3D) printed ABS sheet raster angle, four linguistic variable value known as low, medium, high and very high have been assigned. Fifteen linguistic values have been assigned for the output parameter which is the tensile shear strength. From the fuzzy surface views, the factors that influence the tensile shear strength has been determined. Increased laser power gives higher tensile shear strength. Decreasing 3-D printed ABS sheet raster angle will give higher joint strength that leads to higher tensile shear strength. When the joining speed decreases, the tensile shear strength also increases due to higher heat input being generated and stronger weld penetration. Overall, laser power has the highest influence in determine the tensile shear strength, followed by 3-D printed ABS sheet raster angle and lastly joining speed.",

Pharmaceutical supply chain network faces different risks at every stage of the chain. While the end user of a pharmaceutical supply chain is patients, it becomes more important to manage and minimize the risks in the system. There are some methodologies that are used for this aim. Minimizing many risks at the same time requires a multi objective solution methodology. A fuzzy based goal programming model is proposed to minimize the risk factors in a pharmaceutical supply chain in this paper. Linguistic expressions are used to define the importance of risks. To increase a deep and sensitive analysis, the fuzzy set theory is adopted in the proposed methodology that consists of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and goal programming (GP). Firstly a fuzzy ahp is used to prioritize the risks that can occur in pharmaceutical supply chain. The risks are related to demand planning, transport and storing conditions in pharmaceutical sector. Then a goal programming model is developed to minimize these risks. A real case application in pharmaceutical warehouse company in turkey is analyzed to check and confirm the model.",

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) in our gastrointestinal tract is responsible for normal gut function, including peristaltic contraction. Embryonic development of the ENS involves the colonization of the gut wall from one end to the other by a population of proliferating neural crest (NC) cells. Failure of these cells to invade the whole gut results in the relatively common, potentially fatal condition known as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Probabilistic cellular automata (CA) models provide insight into the colonization process. At the population level, the results exhibit an organised colonization wave, which extends through frontal expansion. Under a certain range of proliferation probabilities, the success or failure of colonization in the CA models is not certain, but probabilistic. At the individual level, a full exploration of agent progeny provides insight into a highly unequal clonal contributions. The CA models generated experimentally testable predictions, which have subsequently been confirmed. The model results imply that HSCR is chiefly a NC cell proliferation defect and not, as previously thought, a NC cell motility defect. The phenomenon of incomplete penetrance seen in a number of birth defects including HSCR, where possession of a dominant causative mutation does not ensure the defect, is also explained by the CA results.",

    "abstract": "An Electromagnetism-like Mechanism algorithm (EM) is a metaheuristic search algorithm known for its ability to solve complex global optimization problems. In a standard EM, the size of the search steps is randomly determined. In this paper, an investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of search step size on the overall convergence performance of EM. A standard EM is modified into two different sets of algorithms with different extremes of search step sizes. The modified algorithms are then tested in 10 standard benchmark functions to evaluate the effect of search step sizes on the performance of each. The results show that the modified EM with smaller search steps performed a much more detailed search for possible solutions in all dimensions. This enabled the overall convergence to achieve relatively higher accuracy in objective values.",

Finally, bilateral filtering algorithm was used for point cloud smoothing to achieve further smoothing of point cloud data. The experimental results showed that the point cloud denoising algorithm proposed in this paper could effectively remove obvious noise points and random noise points, and the overall error of the smoothing algorithm was 2.03%. Compared with the model established by the unprocessed point cloud data, the error of the three-dimensional model established by the processed point cloud data was smaller than that of the entity model, which was only 0.01%. The experimental results proves the reliability of the algorithm proposed in this paper and the importance of point cloud processing and makes some contributions to the better application of three-dimensional laser scanning technology in three-dimensional reconstruction.",

However, they bring vibration problems. Researchers studied numerous methods to eliminate the undesirable vibrations. These treatments are expected to be a compact, light, intellectual and modular system. Recently, nonlinear techniques which are known as Synchronized Switch Damping (SSD) technique was proposed. These techniques synchronously switched when structure got to its displacement extremes that leading to a nonlinear voltage on the piezoelectric elements. This paper presents a performance analysis of an improved modal SSDI approach called “SSDI Max”. The particularity of this new approach is to maximize the self generated voltage amplitude by a proper definition of the switch instants according to the chosen targeted mode. This paper presents simulations performed on a model representative of a smart beam. Damping results are given in the case of multimodal excitations. The paper analyses the control time window influence on the damping performance of the system. Results show that substantial damping increase can be obtained with very slight modification of the control architecture and the same control energy.",

The original VIKOR method has been proposed to identify compromise solutions, by providing a maximum group utility for the majority and a minimum of an individual regret for the opponent. In its original setting, the method treats exact values for the assessment of the alternatives, which can be quite restrictive with unquantifiable criteria. This will be true especially if the evaluation is made by means of linguistic terms. For this reason, we extend the original VIKOR method so as to process such data and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation in a fuzzy environment.

    "abstract": "In order to calculate the effective reflection area (ERA) of a sphere corner cube retroreflector array (SCCRA) with any structural parameters, coordinate transformation matrixes and the reflection law and refraction law in vectors are applied. The expression of the ERA for a SCCRA is derived. The expression is related to the elevation angle, the azimuth angle of the incident light and the structure parameters of the corner-cube retroreflector (CCR) in the SCCRA. The ERA for the SCCRA with different structure and the different incident light can be obtained by the expression. CryoSat-LRR-01 used in the satellite CryoSat is taken as an example to confirm that the ERA expression is right and explain how to use the expression for a specific SCCRA. The result of calculation shows that the ERA is varying with the changes of the elevation angle and the incident azimuth angle. The variation corresponds to the SCCRA structure. It is a confirmation of the correction of the ERA expression.",

Because the heat resource density of the laser beams increased with the increasing laser power. When the laser power was constant the highest temperature in the meltpool, the meltpool width and depth increased with the decrease of scanning speed. The reason was that the interaction time between laser beam and powder increased, and the heat flux increased, which resulted in the increase of the meltpool size and the scan line width. The temperature in middle of single track was lower than that of both ends, there were larger temperature gradient and high thermal stress in the position of scanning direction alteration, which gave rise to the occurrence of warping deformation. When the layer thickness was 0.15 mm, laser power was 150 W, scanning speed was 150 mm/min, the GH4169 alloy powder was successfully prepared by the SLM process.",

    "abstract": "A theoretical-analytical investigation on the vibrational behaviour of gasdynamic lasing molecules is carried out. In fact, the Morse potential is regarded to act over the inter-nuclear axis of the molecules which, as a result, behave as quantum anharmonic oscillators. Although our formulation is centered on diatomic molecules (consider, for example, carbon-monoxide molecules), it is well-known that, by virtue of the united-atom approximation, the Morse potential is also suitable to describe the vibrational behaviour of certain polyatomic molecules as, for instance, carbon-dioxide molecules. In the present article, we establish a quasi-macroscopic (or mesoscopic) model to determine the (minimum) center of mass velocity of a diatomic molecule relative to a gasdynamic laser. More precisely, we determine the above velocity for relatively large quantum vibrational states belonging to the finite set of bound quantum states due to the Morse potential. We show that this situation, although far from the classical limit, may be viewed as quasi-macroscopic or mesoscopic.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrated a passive Q-switched Erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) based on Thulium fiber saturable absorber (SA). The EDFL generates a Q-switching pulse operating at 1564 nm as the pump power is increased above the threshold pump power of 66 mW. The Q-switching operation is maintained before disappearance when the pump power is above 104 mW. This is due to the fact that the thulium fiber could not fully recover in time after a pulse and less gain populations is excited before the next pulsing. With the SA, the laser produces a stable pulse train with repetition rate ranging from 2.18 to 3.16 kHz and the pulse width reduces from 127.4 to 75.4 μs while varying the pump power from 66 mW to 104 mW. The maximum pulse energy of 8.2 nJ is obtained at a pump power of 104 mW. The advantages of the fiber-based saturable-absorbers are their ability to hold enormous gain excited in the gain fiber from lasing and their high damage threshold for high-power Q-switched pulses.",

The turbulent velocity field of river water is measured using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) method in which small bubbles are seeded into the water as nonpolluting tracing particles. Using the velocity field as prior knowledge for image restoration and reconstruction in an underwater laser imaging exploration system, experimental results prove that the proposed method can effectively measure the properties of the turbulent flow and improve the resolution and quality for imaging in turbid ocean water.

The formation of the nanoparticles is based on the controlled drying of sol-gel droplets in a heated laminar flux inside a tubular furnace. Two types of nanoparticles were prepared, hybrid core-shell nanoparticles and silicate nanoparticles doped with an europium(III) complex. In the first case of hybrid (organic-silicate) coreshell nanoparticles the fast evaporation of THF solvent enhance the polycondensation of the silicate network in the droplets, particularly at their surface. This induces first the formation of a silicate crust followed, at the end of the solvent evaporation, by the nucleation and growth of the organic dye in the core of the resulting dried nanoparticles. We studied the different physical and chemical parameters that influence the perfect and reproducible control of the confined nucleation and growth of dye nanocrystals in the sol-gel droplets. In the second case, silicate nanoparticles were doped with a functionalized tris-dipicolinate europium complex, which presents an important two-photon absorption cross section but exhibits a weak stability in water due to the dissociation of the complex. Two different compositions of the starting sols were tested to adjust the hydrophilic character of the nanoparticles and to avoid the dissociation of the europium complexes in water by closing the porosity of the silicate shell.",

    "abstract": "During recent years, determining supplier selection in the supply chain has become very important as a core competency for organizations. Trying to establish an effective and long term communication and cooperation with suppliers can play an important role in strengthening and balancing of supply chain. However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem that includes both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors may be in conflict and may also be uncertain and it needs adequate methods to be evaluated. This process is becoming more complex when a group of decision makers have to make some controversial decisions. In this paper, we tried to utilize a fuzzy programming method to determine the order size from each supplier and apply different criteria that are in contrast with each other. For solving this problem we first determined the related weight of each variable in the objective function by utilizing a fuzzy VIKOR method. In VIKOR model we assumed that compromising is acceptable for conflict resolution and decision makers want a solution that is the closest to the ideal solution, and the alternatives are evaluated according to all established criteria. Also linguistic values are used to assess the ratings and weights for these factors. These linguistic ratings can be expressed in fuzzy numbers. After obtaining weights of variables by Fuzzy VIKOR, constraints were determined. Then with contribution of fuzzy VIKOR prioritization, the weight of each alternative (supplier) is calculated. Then we put each alternative with its weight in a multiple objectives model to determine order size of each alternative. Solving the fuzzy multiple objectives model leads us to each supplier’s order size. Finally for solving the Fuzzy MODM (Multiple Objective Decision Making) we apply α-cuts and calculated different results in relation to every α-cut.",

With the aim of reducing the leakage power of CMOS devices, during digital circuit construction obligatory low supply voltages and low power consumption. In the digital circuits leakage power is leading factor, which is mainly influenced to the power consumption. For low power applications, A reduction in leakage power is important. High leakage currents are the major giver of total power consumption of the CMOS circuit. Advance in technology, the traditional CMOS technique is compared with the self-controllable switch (SVL) technique. Various leakage reduction techniques are employed for reduce leakage and power, SVL technique is one of them leakage reduction technique. In order to achieve power consumption and power dissipation, a self-controllable voltage level switch is used in proposed method. Simulation is done by using cadence virtuoso environment at various supply voltages (0.3 to 1.2 V). By using this leakage optimization technique in voltage level shifter, 89% leakage power is reduced as compared to power gating technique.",

In this paper, a novel algorithm for the enhancement of faint cracks was proposed based on the finite ridgelet transform (FRIT). Furthermore we proposed the improvements on the initial design of the FRIT in order to have better energy compaction and to reduce the “wrap-around” effect. The FRIT approach, with its “built-in” linear geometrical structure, provided a more elegant way of enhancing the linear singularities and suppressing the noise. In general, the pavement cracks show the curved feature as a whole. A smooth partition method was proposed to divide the pavement crack image into localised windows where the crack looks straight. Then, we could apply the FRIT-based enhancement method in each window. Experimental results show that the new algorithm outperforms wavelets in enhancing the low-quality images with linear singularities.",

Although the measurements concern data in the range up to 5000 K, the critical region however, is mostly far beyond the region accessible experimentally at present, with the exception of alkali metals. Knowledge of the phase diagrams and of the critical data are of fundamental interest and important for high-temperature technologies. Thus an attempt is made to extrapolate the available data into the critical region. A novel approach for extrapolating the density data is applied taking into account recent theoretical developments in the field of critical phenomena, which are the crossover from the universal criticality of the 3d-Ising model towards mean-field behaviour, and the theory of complete scaling that describes the nonlinearity of the diameter of the phase diagrams. The method is tested on phase diagrams of cesium, for which accurate phase diagrams up to the critical region are available. Comparison is made with measurements of the critical temperature by the ‘exploding wire technique’ of gold, lead and zinc. Corresponding state behaviour of the metals is discussed.",

In this paper a neural network approach has been applied for backward elimination sensitivity analysis of laser-related parameters during laser perforation in sandstone. For this purpose a feed-forward with back-propagation neural network was developed that predicted the volume removed due to laser power, lasing time and pulsation. The data is related to around 110 laser perforation laboratory tests on sandstone core samples. Finally, sensitivity analysis was done and the effectiveness of each laser-related parameter was determined.",

The pores within the EECSLW joint sharply reduced in comparison with that within laser welding joint, especially when a high external electric current was used. The weld depth and cross-sectional area also increased considerably with external electric current. EECSLW was a better process that evidently did not undermine the microstructure and microhardness of the joint.

A Gaussian distributed heat load is applied to the sintering region using the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). The temperature distribution and change rule are investigated in the sintering process. The results show that the highest temperature lies at the laser spot centre, and the temperature gradually decreases with the increasing distance from the laser spot centre. The sintered shape is concave which is consistent with the isotherms. The densification process of β-TCP occurs where the sintering temperature is over 850ºC. The microstructure test of sintered parts verifies the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results at different temperature distribution regions. These results provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the process parameters of laser sintering.",

Nano-scale circuit for logic device is possible with QCA. Fingerprint is a useful signature to perform user authentication. Fingerprint is recognized with the help of biometric. So, biometric is the integral part for user authentication. A reversible design for fingerprint authenticator circuit has been proposed in this paper. As a platform to implement the authenticator circuit, QCA is used. The circuit designed is a new QCA Feynman gate. The proposed Feynman gate has lower design complexity, i.e., area, cell count and latency over existing QCA Feynman gates. The theoretical values are identical with the simulation results which claim the design accuracy. Power dissipation by the layouts describes that QCA would be an appropriate device to implement reversible circuits.

Limited by the cost of transport operation and maintenance, the long-term in situ monitoring of mountainous pastoral road slopes is still deficient. In this paper the longterm field monitoring of a typical slope in mountainous areas is carried out using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technology. The instability and collapse of the slope are successfully monitored and forewarned. By analysing the temporal and spatial deformation evolution characteristics, the catastrophe mechanism of the slope is revealed. The results show that the results of TLS are in good agreement with GNSS data, and TLS has incomparable advantages for the surface monitoring of dangerous slopes. The geological condition is the internal cause of the landslide, and continuous heavy rainfall is the main trigger factor of the landslide. Loose deposits and sparse vegetation cover on the surface are also important reasons for sliding. This study provides reliable monitoring data for the subsequent reinforcement measures of the slope. Also, it provides a valuable reference for the low-cost monitoring and early warning of risk slopes in mountainous areas.",

Investigations on the surface roughness of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin films become an important issue because the surface roughness of poly-Si thin films is widely believed to be related to its electrical characteristics. A low-cost optical measurement system for rapid surface roughness measurement of poly-Si thin films fabricated by frontside ELC and backside ELC is developed in this study. It is found that the incident angle of 20° is a good candidate for measuring the surface roughness of poly-Si thin films. The surface roughness, y, of poly-Si thin films can be determined rapidly from the average value of the reflected total power, x, measured by the optical system developed using the trend equation of y = -0.9369x+1.0267. The maximum measurement error rate of the optical measurement system developed is less than 6.21%. The savings in measurement time of the surface roughness of poly-Si thin films is up to 83%. Backside ELC is recommended for batch production of low-temperature polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors due to lower surface roughness of poly-Si films and higher laser beam utilization efficiency.",

For achieving a good estimation of the EMG signal, a hybrid intelligent model was created by using clustering combined with regression techniques. It was employed a real dataset obtained from patients undergoing anesthesia during surgeries. The proposed model was validated and the obtained results were very satisfactory.",

In this paper, a new approach is proposed using Mnemonic Cellular Automata (m-CA) which strives towards detecting scene text on natural images. Initially, an edge map is calculated and consequently binarized. Then, taking advantage of the Hybrid Cellular Automata (CA) flexibility, the transition rules are changed and are applied in different consecutive steps. Initially, its rules partially depend on Coordinating Logic Filters (CLF) and the majority state. Moreover, in the final steps of the m-CA evolution the update rules are modified as the history of past evolution steps is incorporated into each cell.

Such a scheme allows for relaxation of timing constraints among disjoint partitions of the logic circuitry since lower frequency local clocking is required as compared to the system clock frequency at the cost of increased clock distribution network area. The disadvantage is that multiple clock distribution trees are required, one for each clock domain or phase within the integrated circuit. Clock distribution networks have the highest fanout of any circuit within typical ICs and represent a significant amount of resource utilization. We devise a method that retains the advantages of multi-phase IC design, but utilizes a single global multiple-valued clock signal distribution network versus separate distribution networks for each phase in an ASIC or custom VLSI implementation. The technique requires a minimal amount of modification to existing multiphase designs and is evaluated and compared to traditional multiphase designs. Furthermore, the approach is applicable to programmable logic (FPGA) implementations through distributing the multiple-valued clock signal using log",

By developing the technology of high power lasers in recent years, applying high power lasers in perforating oil and gas wells will be so advantageous due to its economical and technical priorities over the explosive shaped charges. Unlike the conventional explosive shaped charge perforation that often causes great reduction of rock permeability, laser perforation would enhance the rock permeability which leads to increasing oil or gas production rate of the well. In this way, the efficiency of laser perforation can be determined due to specific energy. Specific energy is defined as the amount of energy required to remove a unit volume of rock. In this study, feed-forward with back-propagation and generalized regression neural networks have been designed to predict the specific energy during laser perforation in limestone which is one of the most common rock formations in oil and gas reservoirs. Effective parameters in laser perforation like laser power, lasing time, pulsation and pressure which are related to laboratory tests done by ytterbium-doped multi-clad fibre laser on core samples are the inputs and the specific energy is the output of the neural networks. The designed neural networks showed high correlation coefficients with low error and the specific energy for limestone was predicted successfully.",

Two samples with different structures were prepared: dye uniformly infiltrated structure and nano-engineered sandwich-like structure. For the later, we could exclude the presence of fluorophores at the surface of the crystal. For both structures, it was found that the stopband in the transmission spectrum was deeper than the stopband in the emission spectrum. We conjecture that the omnidirectional propagation of the emission from a point source in an incomplete photonic band gap material is the cause of the shallower stopband in emission.",

The surface roughness and adhesive bond strength of textured and grit blasted specimens were evaluated.

The surface roughness of the textures varies with the contact area. The laser surface microtextured specimens show approximately 92% increase in adhesive bond strength over a grit blasted specimen. The adhesive bond strength of the laser microtextures depends on the NiCrAlY coating deposition nature and adhesion ratio. The absence of a recast layer was noted as improving the NiCrAlY coating deposition. The heaviness groove microtexture shows higher adhesive bond strength with higher adhesion ratio and adequate NiCrAlY coating deposition. The chevron dimple microtexture shows lower adhesion bond strength due to lower adhesion ratio and inadequate NiCrAlY coating deposition.",

In this research, Hierarchical Advance Soft Computing Techniques (HASCT) has been proposed to analyze the performance factor of e-commerce in various sectors of smart cities platform. Furthermore, HASCT evaluates the relative value of the different strategic components using unrelated regression models in e-commerce.

Furthermore, the Fuzzy Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model (DEMATEL) has been introduced for effective decision making and measure the success factors of e-commerce.

Brownian motions of nanoparticles may contribute to the thermal conductivity enhancement. In this paper the motions of nanoparticles in a ferro-nanofluid flow were investigated with the laser speckle velocimetry (LSV) technique. Speckle patterns of the nanofluid were recorded by a CCD camera and processed with a cross-correlation algorithm to obtain nanofluid flow vectors. According to the findings, the overall motion trend of nanoparticles was along the pipe flow direction. To a small extent, however, nanoparticle motion vectors deviated from the axial direction. Further average processing over multiple vector diagrams yielded flow vectors obeyed typical laminar flow profile, which means that the derivations in flow direction were random in nature, and resulted from Brownian motions of the nanoparticles. The study indicates that LSV could be a useful tool for visualizing nanofluid flow.",

However, this is a different situation for three-dimensional (3-D) LF. To advance this process further for realistic forming applications and for straightening and aligning operations in a manufacturing industry it is necessary to consider larger scale controlled 3-D LF. The work presented in this paper uses a predictive and adaptive approach to control the LF of mild steel and aluminium sheet into a desired surface. Key to the control of the process was the development of a predictive model to give scan strategies based on a required geometry and the surface error. The forming rate and distribution of the magnitude of forming across the surface were controlled in the closed loop by the process speed. When the geometry is not formed within one pass, an incremental adaptive approach is used for subsequent passes, utilising the error between the current and desired geometry to give a new scan strategy, thus any unwanted distortion due to material variability can be accounted for and distortion control and removal is possible.",

This novel device has the ability to suppressing the leakage current due stack techniques, avoiding the bipolar parasitic effect due to graded channel and simultaneously achieving higher breakdown voltage and better analog and RF performances. Therefore this device needs to be studied thoroughly for non uniform doping and different high K oxide materials to be reliable for future applications. Different parameters related to analog performances, such as output resistance, intrinsic gain, early voltage and output are studied. Similarly different RF parameters are also found out considering nonquasi- static (NQS) effect by interchanging the doping concentration and high-K layer materials.

A comparative study is made for laser butt welding of Ti6Al4V and 316 stainless steel of thin plates under identical machining conditions. The present study reports that surface roughness increases with increase in laser energy. It is also observed that micro-hardness value for 316 stainless steel in the fusion zone (FZ) is much higher than the base material (BM) in comparison to Ti6Al4V. This phenomenon may be attributed to higher cooling rate observed in case of 316 stainless steel as compared to Ti6Al4V. A desirability function approach (DFA) has been used to acquire optimal parametric settings for instantaneous optimization of the quality characteristics considered in this study for both the materials. The study indicates that the 316 stainless steel samples exhibit superior overall desirability value as compared to the Ti6Al4V elements.

Special role of the dipole moment as a macroscopic parameter of a medium accounts for a relationship between the photorefraction and the photoconductivity characteristics and it can be considered as an indicator of following dynamic parameters change, that can be responsible for the high speed display elements, laser switchers, medicine instruments improvements, etc. Moreover, some mechanical achievements of the nanoobjects-containing network are observed.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is an automatic choice for many pattern recognition tasks where dimensionality reduction is sought for minimizing the processing time. In spite of being a well-explored domain, mutual information based feature selection methods are currently in emergence because of their significant performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a weighted version of the well-known Maximal Relevance Minimal Redundancy criterion for the purpose of feature selection. The weight of the average redundancy of the candidate feature against all the selected features is continuously incremented with respect to the number of features already selected, while the weight of the class relevance of the candidate feature is kept fixed. An existing variant of normalized mutual information score is utilized for the first time to compute both the relevance as well as the average redundancy. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated to be superior to those of several conventional mutual information based feature selection techniques as well as some of the state-of-art feature selection approaches based on analyses on some real-life high dimensional datasets.",

The imparted data can last for decades, and the many writable layers means terabyte scale capacities can be achieved. The film consists of alternating layers of a transparent polymer and a polymer doped with an organic fluorescent dye, which is written by photobleaching using a CW Blu-ray laser. Images have been written in 23 layers with little observable cross-talk because of the physical layering scheme. In addition, we have explored the photophysics of the dye response, which reveal a nonlinear writing process for short duration writing pulses suggesting the possibility of even lower crosstalk and sub-diffraction limit writing. The mechanism of the non-linear response is also discussed.",

The capability of a developed welding set-up to maintain those conditions is shown. The set-up consists of a laser scanning head, a novel clamping device and deformation measuring systems. Due to low stiffness of thin metal foils, handling the specimen can influence its shape and properties significantly. Therefore, influences on the welding process are minimized by appropriate sample preparation, handling, and the use of an integrated non-contact deflectometry measuring system. The suitability of the set-up for deep penetration laser micro welding and investigation of distortion behaviour in the micro range is demonstrated. Influences of geometrical and process parameters on out-of-plane and in-plane distortion effects are reported.",

To control the forming accuracy and optimize the process parameters, the effects of the process parameters on the bending deformation along the heating line, warping deformation and local thickening of heating area are analysed using the three-dimensional (3-D) thermoelastoplastic finite element method (FEM) in the paper. Validation of the numerical simulation is made by the experiments. The numerical results show that the forming accuracy of plate can be improved as the laser power increases. The curvature along the heating line and the relative variation value of bending angle increase, but the variation of the local thickening decreases with the increase of the scanning speed and the spot diameter. The variation trend of the curve along the heating line and the bending angle at a higher temperature is different from that at a lower temperature. Consequently, the process parameters have an important influence on the undesirable deformation. The forming accuracy of the plate can be raised by means of choosing the reasonable process parameters..",

Having a well-established health facility web service can be useful with regards to that facility’s reputation and recognition. This paper presents an explanation for healthcare facility websites’ quality performance under distinctive evaluation criteria by rating and accordingly ranking them. The most significant feature of this study is how it deals with the interaction characteristics among the selected decision criteria for the website evaluation process. The method uses Intuitionistic Fuzzy Choquet Integral (IFCI) approach under group decision making (GDM) settings. To verify its usefulness, the proposed approach is applied to evaluate the quality of websites of eight medical facilities located in Istanbul, Turkey. The results show that criteria interaction is a significant factor in the selection of suitable website, and can extensively alter the rankings among alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays volume values are used in many engineering studies, such as road projects, mining enterprises, geological works and building applications. A volume can be computed by geodetic, trapezoidal and improved methods such as Simpson-based, cubic spline, and cubic Hermite formula. These improved methods model the object surface as nonlinear profiles. As the associated technology has developed then so have the opportunities for the development of new techniques in surface modelling. Now, the generation of a three-dimensional (3D) model is generally achieved by non-contact systems based on light waves and can be completed on a computer. This is particularly useful in situations where there are risks attached to reaching the location to be modelled – the calculations can be performed from a photograph or from scanned images of the object. In this study the performance of a laser scanning method, robotic total station instrument and geodetic method of volume computation were investigated. The volume computation was carried out using these methods in an excavation area and the methods were compared in terms of accuracy, time and cost. It was concluded that all the methods can satisfactorily be used for volume computing; however, the choice of method should be made according to the location and size of area, required accuracy, budget and time frame.",

The specialism is that though this newly developed fuzzy hidden Markov chain depends on two values the state sequence remains a Markov chain.

This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller in size and intelligent.

Wireless sensor networks consist of sensor nodes with sensing and communication capabilities. As sensor nodes are generally battery-powered devices, the critical aspects to face concern how to reduce the energy consumption of nodes, so that the network life time can be increased to reasonable times. In this paper, we first describe the energy consumption for components of a typical sensor node and discuss the main directions to energy saving methods in wireless sensor networks. Then we present a systematic and comprehensive taxonomy of the energy optimization methods in wireless sensor networks.

The Sm 2 O 3 SA film has a modulation depth and saturation intensity of 30% and 90 MW/cm 2 , respectively. The proposed Q-switched EDFL operated stably at 1558.4 nm. The repetition rate was tunable in a range from 75.8 kHz to 99.5 kHz with the raise of pumping power from 81.0 mW to 131.9 mW. At the maximum pumping power of 131.9 mW, the highest pulse energy of 143.9 nJ and the lowest pulse width of 2.12 µs were attained. A stable soliton mode-locked laser was observed at a central wavelength of 1561.6 nm when an additional 100 m long single-mode fiber was incorporated into the cavity. The mode-locking operation was maintained at pump power range within 91.2 mW to 142.0 mW with repetition rate of 1.88 MHz and pulse width of 3.40 ps. At 142.0 mW, the maximum pulse energy of 12.00 nJ and peak power of 3.53 kW were obtained.

The approach enables multiple experts on evaluation and uses a new triangular fuzzy scale containing also negative fuzzy numbers to establish fuzzy comparison decision matrices. It uses a very easy normalization formula to get importance weights of attributes. It yields final importance weights by triangular fuzzy numbers without any defuzzification. At the final stage, an area-based ranking method is used for ranking the alternatives. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a case study in a computer seller firm is given.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a simple approach to optically tune/switch the wavelength selectivity of a grating assisted directional coupler (GADC) using a strong tuning beam launched into one of the two GADC subwaveguides which is nonlinear. In the absence of the tuning beam, the structure supports a particular wavelength (of weak signal) that exchanges power between the two subwaveguides. In the presence of the tuning beam, refractive index of the nonlinear subwaveguide changes and the modified structure supports the exchange of energy for a different wavelength (of weak signal). We show that desired wavelength could be either gradually or instantly tuned from one wavelength to another to provide power exchange for an appropriate length of the device.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the technology of lasers in the dermatological profession has developed and provided an effective result to patients by using fractional 1550 nm lasers. The depth of skin and quantity of treatment can be controlled step by step. Patients may not have side effects after having treatment and can continue a regular lifestyle. This is because the laser beam is divided in a great number of small beams for each treatment area. The trace of injury cannot be detected by the eye. Controlling the energy of the laser for getting the most suitable depth and trace of injury for each skin disease is very important. Testing the right amount of laser energy for a biopsy from volunteer patients is difficult in terms of data analysis. The sample size could be very limited, which leads to an insignificant statistical result problem. This is because of the ethical problem with regards to conducting research on humans. Therefore, the development of lasers in dermatological profession has been slower than in other industrial and science fields. Inventing a substitute material for experiment with a fractional 1550 nm laser is very important. The substitute material has to have a physical reaction similar to human skin. This will benefit the study of the microscopic heating expansion in human skin before operating with the laser treatment for patients. This research presents natural egg white as a substitute material. Egg white has a mechanism to absorb the energy from a fractional 1550 nm laser, which is similar to mechanism in human skin. Analysis of the pattern of laser beam in egg white by microscope from liquid egg white is fast. This could be done immediately after conducting the experiment. The experiment time and expenses of egg white experiment are 1 and 0.33% comparing to the experiment with volunteer patients.",

It is explored whether students’ instructional conceptions, more specifically conceived functionality of adjunct aids, affect their use, or whether features of the aids themselves are more influential. After assessing students’ instructional conceptions, 255 participants randomly distributed over one control condition or seven experimental conditions studied an instructional text on a computer screen. Conditions differ with respect to the number and nature of adjunct aids. The access of the adjunct aids was monitored. Results show no impact of conceived functionality.

This requirement is particularly difficult to achieve when Al is alloyed with transition metals (TMs) because Al tends to combine with the TM to produce intermetallic compounds, which surround the powder particles, drastically slowing down their dissolution. In this paper the conditions for alloy formation in laser surface alloying of Al with various transition metals were investigated. The laser alloying experiments were performed using Cr, Mo and Nb as alloying elements. A detailed study of the microstructure and composition of the alloys was carried out. Coupling the experimental observations with calculations of the temperature of the melt pool showed that uniform coatings can only be obtained when the temperature of the melt exceeds the melting temperature of the intermetallic compounds which may form as a result of the reactions between the TM and liquid Al. For typical values of the laser alloying parameters, this requirement is only satisfied in the upper regions of the melt pool. In its deeper regions the temperature is lower than this melting temperature and an intermetallic compound layer forms around the TM particles, slowing their dissolution and impeding homogenisation of the liquid.",

Traditionally, matrix multiplication operation is either realized as software running on fast processors or on dedicated hardware (Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)). Software based matrix multiplication is slow and can become a bottleneck in the overall system operation. However, hardware (Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)) based design of matrix multiplier provides a significant speed-up in computation time and flexibility as compared to software and ASIC based approaches respectively. In this paper, we present a study of reported work from past ten years, covering various aspects of FPGA-based design and realization of matrix multipliers. A study of fixed and floating-point designs of matrix multiplier is also presented. Finally, some applications where matrix multiplication is the core operation are highlighted and discussed.",

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) has been a leading EIS (Enterprise Information Systems) application and companies are allocating resources to such new projects. However, studies report that most of the projects fail or cannot reach the desired outcomes selecting inappropriate software is represented as one of the major sources for project failures. This paper focuses on EIS selection problem which is a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem since it contains various and conflicting criteria. In this study, a group decision making approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interval type-2 fuzzy sets is used on a real world ERP selection problem with six criteria and four alternatives. The originality of the study comes from using interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the decision problem. By using interval type-2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy group decision-making problems more flexible decisions can be given since interval type-2 fuzzy sets are more suitable to represent uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy set.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents unsteady computational simulation results and supporting experimental evidence that show a certain fundamental feature of a purely shear driven annular/stratified internal condensing flow with respect to its sensitivity to boundary conditions. This feature is termed “elliptic sensitivity.” Shear driven condensing flows occur in 0g, horizontal channels, and micro-meter scale ducts of any orientation and they often have, or are designed to have, a significant annular/stratified regime. This fundamental feature of the flow allows imposition of several possible values of the mean pressure-difference (unlike the usual situation of having only one pressure difference value) for a given set of quasi-steady values of mass-flow rate, inlet or outlet pressure, and a steady cooling approach for the condensing-surface. By a quasi-steady time-varying flow variable, it is meant that the variable exhibits a steady-in-the-mean value with suitable time periodic fluctuation (s) superposed on it. For most common cooling approaches, when a quasi-steady value of the pressure-difference is changed (even by an amount in the range of 5 – 200 Pa) in time to another quasi-steady value, it often triggers significant changes in the mean condensate thickness, heat transfer rates which induces significant thermal transients, and system characteristics outside the condenser. However if the system always allows the flow to self-seek a “natural” pressure-difference across the condenser, then purely shear driven flows behave like gravity driven and dominated flows in the sense that they are able to achieve a unique and stable realization of a quasi-steady flow with a unique (termed “natural”) value of the pressure-difference. The reported “elliptic” sensitivity feature is absent for gravity dominated flows for which gravity is so strong that it determines the condensate motion as well as its mean interface location.",

The study achieved dynamic simulation of the crack speed, elaborated on the role of the cutting point thermal stress change and analysed the impact of processing parameters, such as laser power, ceramic thickness, cutting speed, on the maximum temperature and stress value on the surface of the alumina ceramic. It is found that normal stress on the laser cutting path undergoes a process of no stress → tensile stress → compressive stress → tensile stress → no stress during the cutting process until the crack grows. The maximum temperature was proportional to the laser power and approximately inverse to the cutting speed. The critical normal stress was found to increase with increasing laser power, a thinner workpiece or slower cutting speed; all of which made microcracks on the fracture surface more evident and thus the surface roughness increased. The FE analysis outcome was verified by experiments leading to a model that could be used to instruct optimization of the laser processing parameters.",

In this paper, we also propose the hybrid of evolutionary learning algorithm (HELA) to tune the P-FCMAC. The proposed HELA combines the compact genetic algorithm (CGA) and the modified variable-length genetic algorithm (MVGA). Both the number of hypercube cells and the adjustable parameters in P-FCMAC are designed concurrently by the HELA. In the proposed HELA, individuals of the same length constitute the same group, and there are multiple groups in a population. The evolution of a population consists of three major operations: group reproduction using the compact genetic algorithm, variable two-part crossover, and variable two-part mutation. Illustrative examples were conducted to show the performance and applicability of the proposed model and method.",

    "abstract": "The great majority of metallic alloys are disordered. Disorder is quantified by means of the probability that a constituent atom is part of nanocrystallites within the alloy specimen, and this probability defines the degree of crystallinity. According to the recently developed, statistical physics-based binary alloy model, the disorder can be modified by thermal forcing applied to the alloy specimen. We have examined the effect of thermal forcing of a 55 W%–45 W% copper-nickel wire specimen on the speed of longitudinal sound wave. A wire specimen is heated to temperatures of one-half to 71% of the alloy’s melting point for as long as more than 15 hours, followed by rapid quenching to room temperature. The notion is that the degree of crystallinity has been forced to undergo changes at different thermal forcing intensities. The response has been measured in terms of the changes in sound speed at room temperature. The results of the measurements are analyzed from the standpoint of disorder modification.",

A 32-bit adder based on the radix-2 signed-digit number system is implemented as a floating-gate-MOS pass-transistor network, where a 32-bit reference data is stored as the threshold voltages of floating-gate MOS transistors. As a result, a fully parallel memory-data access without communication bottleneck is realized in the proposed pass-transistor network. The chip area and the power dissipation of the proposed logic-in-memory VLSI circuit are greatly reduced in comparison with those of a corresponding binary CMOS implementation while yielding almost the same switching delay.",

The importance of these programmable switches comes from the fact that they form the interconnection wiring between various logic cells and also the input/output blocks. There are other parameters, like volatility and non-volatility, on chip reprogrammability, switch-resistance, parasitic capacitance, etc. that also have to be considered as they greatly affected the FPGA loading and programming time.",

Currently, artificial feeler method is used widely in the flatness detection of spiral bevel gear, and this method is simple to operate. However, the low accuracy and human error are the weakness of this method. Combining the laser plane generation technology, the laser detection technology and the embedded control theory, a new on-line detection method of flatness is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the laser plane generated by the laser plane generator is used as the datum of the measurement. Secondly, the position information is detected by the position sensitive detector (PSD). The position information is the height difference between measuring points and the laser plane. Thirdly, the system error is separated from the position information. Using least square method, the on-line detection of automobile gearbox spiral bevel gear flatness is realized by evaluating the data of flatness after error separation. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by experiments.",

A smart classroom is a technological learning approach that is presented as a way of increasing student capability. However, the challenge is to develop learning eco-systems that incorporate smart learning to self-regulate and personalize learning. Hence, in this study, an Improved Smart Learning Pedagogy Framework (ISLPF) has been proposed for teachers and students in the higher education systems. University teachers are included in this improved strategy as the smart devices’ operators and they lead students through relevant tasks. On the other hand, students can take instructions and study with direct guidance from teachers in an improved smart learn- ing environment. The findings demonstrate that the teacher’s position increases the students’ motivation, engagement, and effective learning.",

Due to the remarkable electro-optic properties of LC molecules, they permit to realise high resolution flat TV screen either for direct view or projection applications. The technology is based on the electrical addressing of individual pixels through a thin film transistor driven by matrix electrodes. Beside the display of TV images, LC-SLM are also very well suited for a variety of applications in laser optics as an active optical element which can accurately modulate the phase or the amplitude of a laser wavefront in the visible or near IR spectral regions. This capability of beam shaping with programmable (or a fixed) optical components is now important in growing applications of diode pumped lasers for industry or scientific purposes [1–5]. For these specific applications THALES Research & Technology has developed a particular SLM technology where the addressing of the LC layer is performed optically [6]. This device which consists of a LC photoconductor sandwich is a non pixelated structure. It exhibits high optical quality and no spurious diffraction effects due to periodic electrodes usually used for electrical addressing. We present in the following the SLM technology, its typical performances, and original applications to adaptive optics or intracavity laser beam control. Also, application of holographic photopolymer optical element to laser beam shaping is presented.",

We use trapezoidal fuzzy numbers for activity times and Activity-on-Arcs (AOA) representation in fuzzy critical path method (FCPM).

Point cloud data’s registration method plays an important role in estimating the three-dimensional motion of a rigid object. Meanwhile, different lidars have different performance parameters like the resolution, which is likely to lead to their different performance when conducting indoor positioning. In this paper, we compare and analyse registration results of datasets obtained by different lidars. In the beginning, the fast point feature histograms (FPFH) descriptor is introduced in feature extraction, and the sample consensus method is combined to conduct the coarse registration. Secondly, fine registration of a nearly-aligned initial pose is provided by the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare registration runtime and registration error. The experimental results illustrate that high resolution improves feature recognition and reduces registration error. Among those single-layer and multilayer lidars, the 32-layer one possessed a better balance between the registration accuracy and the time-consumption.",

We observe that moving away from the determinism in von Neumann’s original design impacts CA dynamics to such an extent that sensitive dependence on initial conditions might get lost abruptly, or also the other way around, might arise suddenly. As such, the behavior in a deterministic setting can be unrepresentative for the dynamics one gets in a stochastic setting. In the case of SECAs, it turns out that the involved probabilities should be understood as bifurcation parameters steering the nature of such SECAs, i.e. whether or not they are unstable.",

The HFVWC experiments were carried out based on the high-frequency vibrator system and the mechanism of the residual stress relaxation by the HFVWC method was discussed. The results show that the residual stress of the laser-welded 304 stainless steel specimens can be effectively eliminated and homogenized by the HFVWC method; moreover, improving the high-frequency vibration energy imposed into the materials can improve the effect of the residual stress relief and homogenization. The residual stress relief mechanism of the HFVWC method can be attributed to the stirring effect induced by the high-frequency mechanical vibration and the dislocation activation motion. The findings confirm that the HFVWC method can be used to the industrial application to improve the quality of welded structures.",

The laser surface treatment is carried out using a high power continuous wave diode laser with argon and nitrogen as shrouding gas. Laser surface melting leads to an increased volume fraction of acicular martensite and a decreased volume fraction of the b phase in the microstructure. Laser surface nitriding leads to the formation of titanium nitride dendrites. The micro-hardness could be improved up to a maximum of 450 Hv in laser surface melting and 900–950 Hv in the case of laser surface nitriding as compared to 260 Hv of the as-received substrate. Surface melting increases the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and primary potential for pit formation (Epp1) significantly as compared to the as-received Ti-6Al-4V. However, when processed under similar conditions, surface nitriding shifts Ecorr marginally in the more noble direction, and increased Epp1 as compared to Ti-6Al-4V. The biocompatibility behaviour shows a superior cell viability on surface nitriding and an inferior cell viability on surface melting as compared to the as-received Ti-6Al-4V.",

At the micro-scale in this process, the transient transport mechanisms at the solid-liquid-vapor interfaces during nucleation and subsequent vapor-bubblegrowth dynamics (which essentially characterize macro-scale heat transport and the ebullient signature of boiling), can be altered by introducing small quantities of surface-active additives (reagents or polymers) in a pure liquid (water). The molecular characteristics of reagents affect and control this process; in fact, surface wetting and surface tension can be decoupled. This review delineates those aspects of micro-scale interfacial changes that are essentially caused at a molecular-scale by the relative adsorption-desorption of reagents at the liquid-vapor interface, and their physisorption and electrokinetics at the liquid-solid interface.",

According to the velocity distributions at the equatorial plane of a levitated water droplet, the flow direction of the internal circulation and the external flow of levitated droplet was opposite, since the circulation in the boundary layer predicted in the early studies was likely to exist at the interface of droplet. In our previous studies, it has been confirmed the internal motion and external flow have been strongly affected by the viscosity of a liquid.

At present, infrared image recognition technology can play a good recognition effect in open equipment fault detection, but it cannot directly get the recognition effect of closed equipment, so it needs to be processed by elimination method, which inhibits the application of image recognition technology in substation. Based on this, the infrared identification research is carried out with the 10kV trolley switch cabinet and GIS equipment as the research objects. To be specific, an on-line monitoring scheme for substation equipment fault based on image recognition is developed, and the scheme is applied in the infrared fault identification experiment of the trolley switch cabinet. The results show that the three-phase temperature of copper row behind the static contact seat of the trolley switch cabinet can be found through the perspective window, confirming the feasibility of the scheme. Then, the infrared fault identification experiment of GIS equipment was carried out to find the main cause of equipment heating, and the robustness of the scheme was confirmed again. Through this research, the importance of infrared image recognition technology in substation equipment fault monitoring is affirmed, and the problem that infrared image recognition technology can not directly obtain closed equipment state information is solved in the past, which improves the application of image recognition technology in substation equipment fault monitoring.",

From the ubiquitousness of erosion of compliance it would seem that higher-order learning is surprisingly inefficient in counteracting the subconscious processes of instrumental conditioning. We apply behavioral regulation theory to develop generic system dynamics models of classroom examples of instrumental conditioning. The models capture essential aspects of the theory and they suggest how desirable learning may be promoted and undesired outcomes restrained during an instrumental conditioning process. We discuss how higher-order learning might shift the behavioral bliss point – the individual’s preferred distribution of activities.",

The duct is differentially heated, wherein the opposing vertical walls are maintained at two specified isothermal temperatures, while the horizontal walls are perfectly insulated. Air enters the heated duct in a hydrodynamically fully developed condition, and steadily flows under laminar conditions while undergoing thermal development within the heated duct. For a set of specified temperature differences across the isothermal vertical walls, the heat transfer rate to the airflow is evaluated, and the fluid flow patterns are obtained for a range of flow rates, duct aspect ratios, and wall emissivities. Critically examining the fluid flow patterns and the characteristics of the hot wall Nusselt number, the significance of wall radiation effects on mixed convection heat transfer is identified and analysed in this study. It is found that the interaction of surface radiation and mixed convection influences the transport phenomena within heated ducts.",

During forming process, the sample is bent via four-point bending elastically and then heated with a continuous wave (CW) Nd:YAG laser system in a controllable manner. Since material yield strength decreases with an increasing temperature locally, pre-loaded elastic strain is partially converted into plastic strain, and elastic strain energy is dissipated into plastic work. In this paper, the forming mechanism is studied by analysing the coupled thermostructural field. According to the final shape by simulation, the springback ratio is 78.0% (76.0% by experiment), and the energy dissipation rate is 33.5%.",

The gold particles with a diameter of about 7 nm were functionalized with octadecanethiol and spread at the water surface. The nonlinear optical signal intensity was monitored as a function of the average nanoparticle surface density during a compression-decompression cycle. At all particle surface densities well below the maximum surface density estimated at about 1.4×1016 particles per m2 using a close-compact two dimensional model, the average second harmonic intensity scaled with the square of the average particle surface density. However, large fluctuations of the signal intensity were recorded. A detailed analysis of the intensity histograms showed that these fluctuations could be attributed to both nanoparticle surface density and hyperpolarizability fluctuations. This work not only reveals the heterogeneous nature of the nanoparticle films but also the occurrence of interactions between particles in such two-dimensional systems.",

In the future, vehicle-based laser scanning, here called mobile laser scanning system, should see considerable use for 3-D road environment modelling in urban areas. In this context one of the main limitations perceived by the mobile laser scanning system is the incompleteness of the sampling. Whenever we scan urban area road environment, the produced sampling usually presents a large number of missing regions. Many algorithmic solutions exist to close those gaps from specific hole filling algorithms to the drastic solution of using water-tight reconstruction methods. In this paper, a method for filling holes of road surface point clouds and generating 3-D model of road surface from mobile laser scanning data is developed. The data is classified into road surface, on-road and off-road surface point clouds. Many large holes in the road surface point clouds are filled by using data assimilation algorithm. Then, the road surface is 3-D modelled as a triangulated irregular network. It is shown that the whole road surface 3-D model is integrated after data processing. The above mentioned steps are applied to a large set of mobile laser scanning data of urban area road environment, in order to obtain the whole urban road surface 3-D model.",

    "abstract": "The paper uncovers three so far unsolved problems with Aristotelian categorical propositions (ACPs, formatted as “𝑄𝑥 be/be not 𝑦”, where 𝑄 is a universal or particular quantifier), which puzzle modern logic to assimilate ACPs in representing and deducting knowledge: 1) the inconsistency of particular quantifier resulted from confusing universe-restrictive and -unrestrictive readings, 2) the lack of a manifested quantifier on y, and 3) localization, i.e., there has not been yet such a logic to generate a system of categorical propositions, which completely describe quantitative and qualitative relations complying with a real situation of the categories {x} and {y}, and ubiquitously being linked to various contexts and knowledge systems. Further, the paper has offered solutions to overcome the three problems by reforming the forms of ACPs to create the “fully expanded categorical propositions (FECPs)” with consistent and dyadic fuzzy quantifiers, which makes FECPs compatible to globally be infused in, and transformed into, various knowledge representations, chiefly of classical (first-order and high-order) logic, including set theory, type theory, model theory, and recursion theory (Turning machines), and of modern algebra, probability theory, fuzzy mathematics, informatics, formal languages (Chomsky 0-type grammar) and natural languages. These efforts show a turn of proposition logic and predicate logic in traditional logic into modern logic, expecting knowledge representation, acquisition, and computation of the reformed categorical propositions — FECPs in more exact and ubiquitous manners.",

    "abstract": "Recursive analysis is the most classical approach to model and discuss computations over the real numbers.Recently, it has been shown that computability classes of functions in the sense of recursive analysis can be defined (or characterized) in an algebraic machine independent way, without resorting to Turing machines. In particular nice connections between the class of computable functions (and some of its sub- and sup-classes) over the reals and algebraically defined (sub- and sup-) classes of R recursive functions à la Moore 96 have been obtained. However, until now, this has been done only at the computability level, and not at the complexity level. In this paper we provide a framework that allows us to dive into the complexity level of real functions. In particular we provide the first algebraic characterization of polynomial-time computable functions over the reals. This framework opens the field of implicit complexity of analog functions, and also provides a new reading of some of the existing characterizations at the computability level.",

The time-temperature profiles of different points are analysed, showing that the temperature is sharply decreased away from the weld bead centre. To verify the simulation results the corresponding fiber laser welding experiments are carried out. The results show that the cross-section microstructures of welded joint are mainly composed of molten pool, narrow heat affected zone (HAZ) and stainless steel substrate. The wineglass-like molten pool shape shows good agreement with the simulated results. And the finer microstructure in the weld bead is resulted from the rapid cooling rate of laser welding which is confirmed by the FEM calculation. The finer microstructures of columnar and equiaxed dendrites are formed in the peripheral and central region of the molten pool.",

    "abstract": "When the airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) instrument is in operation, the flight platform is expected to be in uniform linear motion, thus the obtained laser points distribute approximately uniformly on the ground. Unfortunately, due to existence of engine vibration and airflow disturbance, etc., the flight platform cannot be kept in ideal uniform linear motion in actual applications, which makes the platform attitude nonstationary and deviate from the planned route. As a result, the laser points deviated from the ideal positions, and distribute disorderly on the ground. In order to eliminate the influence of the attitude disturbances on the distribution of laser points, a new compensation method for laser pointing deviations was proposed. The scanning mirror was fixed on the centre of a two-axis compensation device that was ever constructed by the research group to which the authors belong. The normal direction of the scanning mirror can be changed to keep the reflected light along ideal direction and hence counteract the influence caused by attitude disturbances. The compensation method can be implemented in the following three steps: (i) Measure the attitude disturbances and the scanning angle using the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the angle encoder in real time, respectively; (ii) calculate the required rotation angles of the inner and outer frames of the two-axis compensation device according to the attitude disturbances and the scanning angle; and (iii) rotate the inner and outer frames of the compensation device to the expected angle positions. To validate the new compensation method, numerical simulations and physical experiments were both carried out. The obtained results demonstrated that the laser point offsets have been greatly eliminated.",

Moving the fibre laser mirror can realize the adjustable distance and position of the dual-beam spot, which is suitable for any welding direction. The energy loss is about 10%.",

Experimental results testified that laser power affect the formation of micron-scale ripple structure, and scan velocity affect the size and period of submicron-scale ripple structure seriously. After tribological tests of different micro- and nano-textured using a nano-indenter we find that submicron-scale ripple structure has the best friction properties because it reduced the contact area between indenter and the stainless steel surface effectively.

The circuit is built around the current-feedback operational amplifier (CFOA). Moreover, a mathematical model for the relationship between the output voltage and incident radiation is obtained. The model, basically a sine-series function, can easily yield closed-form expressions for the harmonic and intermodulation performance of the constant-voltage biased MCT detector with large-amplitude multisinusoidal incident radiation. The special case of two-tone equal-amplitude incident radiation is considered in detail. The results show that the second-order harmonic and intermodulation products are always higher than the third-order components. Moreover, the results show that the second-order intermodulation is always dominant. Furthermore, a comparison with the harmonic and intermodulation performance of constant-current biased MCT detectors is presented. This comparison clearly shows that the nonlinear performance of the constant voltage-biased and the constant current- biased MCT is exactly the same. Thus, in terms of the nonlinear performance, both constant voltage- and constant current-biased MCT detectors are identical. This implies that the previously reported improvement in the nonlinear performance of the constant voltage-biased MCT detector is attributed to the use of proper feedback in the biasing/preamplifier circuit.",

The results showed that the proposed method was accurate enough for the probabilistic analysis of power systems. The voltage expectation and mean square of the node increased with the increase of photovoltaic output power. The power flow expectation of the line decreased with the increase of photovoltaic output power, and the current trend of the line was opposite, which increased with the increase of photovoltaic output power.

We have developed an efficient controlled method for glucose monitoring in turbid media based on femtosecond laser pulses autocorrelation – femtosecond laser autocorrelatory (FLA). A Kerr lens mode-locked Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser at central wavelength of 800 nm was used as femtosecond pulsed light source. Glucose (C6H12O6) and table salt (NaCl) were used as analytes to investigate the temporal shift in the laser pulse. A temporal shift in pulse was measured and the sample containing glucose is revealed to be broadening the pulse more than a salt solution. Further, the pulsed signal can be analysed to measure and identify the boundaries between normal and diseased blood in diabetics",

    "abstract": "The acoustic signal is a good indicator for the weld quality detection in laser welding processing; however, the mechanism of the acoustic signal generation by the vapour flow is not clear. In this paper a two-dimensional (2-D) model is built to investigate the characteristics of acoustic signal generated by the vapour flow in laser welding. By the numerical simulation, the results indicate that the vapour flow velocity in the keyhole centre is higher than the vicinity of the keyhole with the highest velocity of the vapour flow inside the keyhole reaching 280 m/s. To verify the validity of the simulation, typical experiments are presented for laser welding steel plates with a Nd:YAG laser. A microphone is used to sample the acoustic signal and a digital high-speed camera is to observe the contour of the vapour flow. Experimental results are further proven to the extent that the simulation method is effective to analyse the mechanism of acoustic signal generation by the vapour flow.",

Henceforth, we introduce the novel concept of CIFTG, as well as some related concepts such as complex intuitionistic fuzzy (CIF) alternating 4-cycle, complex intuitionistic fuzzy threshold dimension (CIFTD), and complex intuitionistic fuzzy threshold partition number (CIFTPN). Moreover, we establish certain interesting results along with examples, which are helpful to comprehend the theory of CIFTGs.

In nuclear environments when FBG’s are exposed to ionizing irradiation results have shown changes in the Bragg parameters, although the exact causes are still unclear. A theoretical model of FBG is applied to evaluate the radiation-induced change of refractive index and shift of Bragg wavelength as critical parameters in contributing to the performance of FBG dosimeter. The model include extracting transfer function of The FBG reflectivity and its’ pulse response under radiation effects. The validation of the proposed model is investigated, its parameters are simulated and compared with previous measured values, the results are so close to real measured data. The model provides a deeper analysis of the experimental results and the ability to extrapolate and predict the changing of the characteristics of FBG under radiation to use it as a radiation sensor under low and high total gamma dose (0.1-1MGy).",

It is found that the thermal efficiency is high for steel followed by carbon-carbon plain weave and Kevlar laminates. The specific energy required is highest for carbon-carbon plain weave laminates.

The thickness of the Pt metal films on K9 glass and a monocrystalline Si silicon substrate is 20 and 40 nm, respectively, and the Pt films are deposited by the magnetron sputtering technique. The nonequilibrium heat transfer time of the electrons in the Pt films is measured by detecting the transient reflectivity of the probe beam on the Pt films.

If the data points include any level of human judgements, they tend to be vague and imprecise due to the difficulty of providing accurate evaluations. After the ordinary fuzzy sets’ introduction to the literature, it has been successfully applied to such cases and various extensions are proposed. One of the recent extensions is q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets where the sum of the qth power of the membership degree and the qth power of the nonmembership degree is bounded by one thus the space of acceptable orthopairs increases and provides more freedom for decision makers to express their judgements. In this study, a new penthagorean fuzzy k-means clustering method is developed. The 5th power is used as a special case of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets and named as penthagorean fuzzy sets. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example of The Motion Picture Association of America film rating system.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a two-stage multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on classified population (TSCEA) to solve vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). It is a well-known NP-hard discrete optimization problem with three objectives: to minimize the total distance cost, to minimize the number of vehicles, and to optimize the balance of routes within a limited time. For TSCEA, there are two stages: In the first stage, a population is explored using the proposed algorithm and then classified according to the number of vehicles, we call this process population classification; In the second stage, Pareto solution set of tri-objective VRPTW is obtained by optimizing the classified population again. The advantages of classified population structure are that for the first stage, this population that the number of vehicles of each individual is in this range composed of the upper and lower bounds of vehicles can be classified as different small populations with the same number of vehicles. Due to the evolution of small population, Pareto solution set with better extensibility can be searched. For the second one, it can reduce the dimension of tri-objective function, that is, three objective functions can be reduced to two objective functions because one of them has been identified in the first stage. Moreover, to resolve the nonlinear discrete problems, the computational approach of crowding degree is modified. The paper chooses Solomon benchmark instances as testing sets and the simulated results show that TSCEA outperforms the compared algorithms in terms of quality or extension, which verified the feasibility of the algorithm in solving tri-objective VRPTW.",

The results indicated that the flow field expanded following an arc under three different energy conditions and there existed a slow change in the low-density and low-pressure air mass. The whole blast wave velocities increased as the energy increased. The elapsed time for the blast wave velocity decreased to a sonic one and was longer as the energy was increased.

In this paper, we extend the solution to tackle the multi-general problem and show that this approach does effectively leads to a finite cellular automaton. For this, we exhibit a projection function from infinite to finite states and write a program that generates the associated finite transition table.

Furthermore, LOs correspond to nodes in ASTs, making it possible to precisely define both media and content. It also has been shown recently that essentially any pedagogy can be defined independently of content (see TutorIT in Scandura, 2005). Nonetheless, we must be cautious. An inadequate ‘learning object” paradigm (SCORM, IMS) could easily become dominant – due to political or commercial clout – not technical superiority.

    "abstract": "Ternary reversible logic is a promising choice for low-power implementation and is also physically realizable in quantum computation. Two previous methods for ternary reversible circuit synthesis are based on TGFSOPs and Max-Min algebra. Both require high quantum cost and a large number of ancilla inputs. We propose an alternative Max-Min algebra-based method, where ternary logic functions are represented as Max-Min expressions and are realized using multiple-controlled unary gates. We also propose quantum-level realizations of multiple-controlled unary gates. We introduce minimization of Max-Min expressions using K-maps and then propose a hybrid genetic algorithm-based method for minimization and synthesis of ternary reversible circuits. We experimented with 24 benchmark functions of up to five variables. On average our method requires 41.36% lower quantum cost and 35.72% fewer ancilla inputs than the method based on TGFSOPs, and 74.39% fewer ancilla inputs than the previously proposed Max-Min algebra-based method.",

    "abstract": "Fetal monitoring offers vital information about the health state of the unborn child through the analysis of the fetal heart rate (FHR). Abdominal recordings represent an attractive alternative for fetal monitoring, as it is noninvasive and offers the fetal electrocardiogram (fECG), which provides both the instantaneous FHR and the fECG morphology. The problem when working with abdominal signals (ADS) is that the fECG is strongly distorted, mainly by the maternal electrocardiogram (mECG) component which has the dominant energy. In addition, the frequency band of the mECG overlaps that of the fECG and EHG, thereby a simple filter cannot remove the mECG. Considering that the ADS contain other disturbing signals, advanced digital processing technique is required in order to suppress the mECG and to obtain a clean fECG. We proposed an improved ESC method for mECG cancellation from ADS. Furthermore, we want to extend the fECG analysis to better investigate the fetal state, and to extract the electrohysterogram (EHG) from the ADS cleaned from the mECG, to predict the pre-term labour.",

In our method, the target object is irradiated by laser firstly and the object information is captured by ghost imaging, the measured value of background subtraction image obtained by background subtraction is sparse and image is reconstructed by compressive sensing directly. The experiments suggest that our method can not only obtain high quality reconstructed image with lower sampling rate, but also extract the target image in different illumination conditions accurately.

A polar co-ordinate vector map (PMap) was utilized to store environmental information and a cluster ideology was used to describe obstacle features. The local virtual target comprised environment features and target information together and so it was used as a temporary target to guide the robot to track the real goal while accomplishing obstacle avoidance. This method could be applied to obstacles with arbitrary shapes and could reduce the environment memory amount dramatically. It improved the dynamic response performance of the robot and fulfilled real time obstacle avoidance when the robot was following a target. A great deal of robot experiments showed that the propounded strategy was very effective.",

It is realized by a subharmonic oscillator of order three by forcing. It is known that for sinusoidal forcing, a forcing period exactly one-third of the free period is impossible. To overcome this difficulty, an oscillation amplitude-dependent forcing, or impulsive forcing, is proposed, and by numerical simulation, the stable oscillation and the phase control by seed signals are shown. It is found that the rising edge of the keyed forcing signal triggers the definite phase of oscillation. This is a biasing to the seed signal and can be regarded as a type of noise for the seed signal. Its level can be found by numerical simulation. The seed signal level needs to be sufficiently larger than the noise level for proper operation.",

We compare the propagation of both individual spatial modes and Gaussian beams, in both the linear (low-energy) and nonlinear (high energy) regimes. Due to the discrete nature of the set of allowed spatial modes in these waveguides, the propagating light does not uniformly fill the waveguide core under the conditions investigated. Gaussian beams incident from free space propagate as a superposition of allowed modes that maintain a local variation in intensity across the core area during propagation. The higher local intensities of higher-order waveguide modes lead to increased nonlinear absorption. When the incident beam deviates significantly from the fundamental waveguide mode, high-order modes are excited and the waveguide’s nonlinear transmission decreases. These results help to account for the enhanced nonlinear response previously observed in capillary waveguides filled with a nonlinear material in solution.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency identification (RFID) system is susceptible to multiple factors in practical applications such as temperature and metal. Meanwhile, the problems of the effect of humidity on UHF RFID system’s performance keep springing up. In this paper, in order to measure RFID system’s reading performance, the reading distance of RFID tag is used as an evaluation criterion and the effect of humidity on the dynamic identifying property of the ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID testing platform is emphasized. This paper proposes the theory of the effect of humidity on the reading distance of RFID tags, and obtains some valuable simulation results. A humidity control system is designed to adjust the humidity of the RFID system. The laser ranging sensor is used to measure the reading distance of tags under different humidity. The relationship between the reading distance of the tag and the humidity is established. Comparing experimental data with theoretical simulation results, the results show that the correlation coefficient is 94.06%, and the experimental results are in good agreement with the theory; moreover, the corresponding humidity compensation mechanism is derived to obtain the reading distance of the tag at the same reference humidity. Overall, the paper provides an effective method for selecting and evaluating UHF RFID tags under different humidity.",

    "abstract": "We have studied the two-photon absorption performances of specifically engineered triphenylamine derivatives bearing different acceptors (mono-, bis or trisubstitution). Large two-photon absorption cross sections (δ) could be evidenced. These compounds happen also to be weakly emissive in a buffer medium whereas a strong fluorescence signal is induced by addition of DNA, making them very interesting candidates for DNA labelling and high contrast two-photon induced fluorescence microscopy. As a complementary characterization tool for the study of biological systems, we propose an original technique which takes profit of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) effects in molecular solutions. We show that we can use the electric field present inside a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) junction towards creating a local noncentrosymmetry via molecular orientation under the tip. Experiments were performed inside a STM junction immersed in concentrated solutions of azo-dyes molecules chosen for their highly nonlinear properties and the possibility to generate a local SHG signal from those molecules was demonstrated. The potentialities of such technique towards high resolution imaging are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The recently developed three-dimensional spherical fuzzy sets are an extension of the ordinary fuzzy sets, which are effective in handling uncertainty and quantifying expert judgments. The similarity measure is one of the beneficial tools to define the degree of similarity between two objects. It has many vital implementations such as medical diagnosis, and pattern recognition. Some different distance and similarity measures of SFSs have been proposed to literature, but they are limited when compared to other extensions of fuzzy sets. In this study, some novel distances and similarity measures of spherical fuzzy sets are presented. Then, we propose the novel distance measurements such as spherical fuzzy Minkowski k-Chord distance, weighted spherical fuzzy Minkowski k-Chord distance. In addition, f-similarity measures are developed under a spherical fuzzy environment. The newly defined similarity measures are applied to pattern recognition for the COVID-19 virus. In this application, the goal is to determine the main significant group of parameters that cause to spreading of COVID-19 virus in different countries separately. A comparative analysis of new similarity measures is established and some advantages of the proposed study are discussed.",

To the surprise of fabrication technology of discrete components, they have still remained indispensable in the Electrical and Electronics circuitry. Design of a choke possessing the specific characteristics is a cut-and-try iterative affair that largely depends on empirical data of heterogeneous type and bench adjustments involving judgments and decisions by an experienced designer. Here we propose a novel fuzzy based design algorithm-a FLCDA for chokes that amalgamates the knowledge and experience of field experts with diverse ingredients and variety of circuit conditions. The exercise of Fuzzy Logic in the designing process of choke embeds directly the human-knowledge, and exploits the ability of a digital computer to store and access ample data of heterogeneous type of ingredients of a choke. The sample design results on FLCDA have illustrated the potentiality of Fuzzy Logic in encompassing the flexibility to the designer in yielding an optimized component by more qualitative rather than conventional analytical algorithms.",

The results show that the oscillating welded joint with the same power has a smaller depth-to-width ratio than the linear welded joint. Laser oscillating welding can refine the grain of the welded joint by disturbing the molten pool, promote uniform mixing of steel and Al reduce defects, and improve the mechanical properties of the welded joint. The microhardness test reveals that the microhardness of the weld zone (WZ) of the three scanning paths is higher than that of the base material (BM); the microhardness of the joint welded in the spiral mode is the highest, and that of the steel side joint and the Al side joint can reach 365 and 302 HV, respectively. The tensile strength of the joint welded in the zigzag mode is the best, and the shear strength per unit length can reach 137 N/mm.",

The multiple-irradiation laser bending process is affected by inter-pass time between successive scanning. The effects of sheet size and constant line energy are also studied.

The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes schedule risk and maximizes the minimum satisfaction degrees of all activities.

The results showed that for granite and sandstone samples, both laser perforation depth and specific energy increase with prolonging laser irradiating duration. As for granite, the laser perforation induced fracture mechanism was attributed to cleavage, with secondary cracks and numerous regular small platforms on the fracture surfaces. For sandstone samples, clean laser perforated holes consisting of a grey glaze layer and a brown heat affected zone (HAZ) were found, with secondary cracks existing in the inner walls. Meanwhile, obvious cavity and large voids could be easily found in the HAZ, which might be helpful for breaking the cementations and mineral grains. Of significance, laser perforation could lead to reduced mechanical performance of both granite and sandstone; for example, after laser perforation with nine holes, granite and sandstone exhibited compressive strengths of 51.48 and 8.92 MPa, respectively. This is approximately only a quarter of their original values, indicating the feasibility of rock fragment by laser technology.",

    "abstract": "Laser pulse heating of surfaces results in high temperature gradients in the region irradiated by the laser beam. This, in turn, results in thermal strain and stress fields. In the case of laser gas assisted processing, convective boundary conditions arise on the surface of the substrate material. Consequently, an investigation into laser induced thermal stresses is essential. In the present study, laser pulses decreasing exponentially with time and with a convective boundary condition at the surface is considered and a closed form solution for thermal stress distribution obtained using a Laplace transformation method. Steel is employed to simulate the temperature and stress fields. It is found that the influence of the heat transfer coeffcient on the temperature profile is significant at a dimensionless heat transfer coeffcient of 0.0202. The thermal stress is tensile in the vicinity of the surface and becomes compressive at some depth below the surface. A thermal stress wave is developed for a dimensionless heat transfer coeffcient of 0.0202.",

    "abstract": "Modeling refers to the establishment of a description of a system in mathematical terms, which characterizes the input-output behavior of the underlying system. The process of developing a model under fuzziness is termed fuzzy modeling. Fuzzy logic can provide a promising alternative to mathematical modeling for many physical systems that are too vague or too complicated to be described by simple and crisp mathematical formulas or equations. When fuzzy logic is employed, the interval of confidence and the fuzzy membership functions are used as approximation measures, leading to the so-called fuzzy systems modeling. The Fuzzy Modeling has been applied in a wide variety of fields such as Engineering and Management Sciences and Social Sciences to solve a number decision making problems which involve impreciseness, uncertainty and vagueness in data. Fuzzy decision making is a powerful paradigm for dealing with human expert knowledge.",

Photons of Laguerre-Gaussian light carry optical orbital angular momentum, while circular polarized light comprises photons with optical spin angular momentum. Since it has been reported that, in mechanical processes, optical orbital angular momentum is equivalent to optical spin angular momentum, it seems very natural to expect chiral interaction between Laguerre-Gaussian light and chiral matter. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that Laguerre-Gaussian light is NOT specific in its interaction with chiral matter through a linear optical process; only circular polarization can engage with materials chirality.",

The MLI is consisted of reflecting layer and netting spacer between reflecting layers. Therefore, conduction heat transfer phenomenon can be occurred between layers of MLI because they are physically contacted each other. The accurate measurement and analysis of heat transfer of MLI is necessary to predict heat invasion through MLI and design of temperature control apparatus. We have developed the thermal conductivity measurement apparatus using a refrigerator as a heat sink and MLI is used as a specimen. The apparent thermal conductivity of specimen is measured over a temperature range of 40-240 K using a steady state method. The specimen is thermally connected to the refrigerator and electrical heater is installed between the specimens to generate heat and axial flow into the specimen symmetrically. The temperature gradient is measured between specimens, from which the apparent thermal conductivity value is calculated. The effect of temperature and contact pressure on the apparent thermal conductivity of MLI is quantitatively discussed.",

Building on this, we define many-valued versions of the Euler characteristic of a formula ϕ, and prove that they indeed provide information about the logical status of ϕ in Gödel logic. Specifically, our first main result shows that the many-valued Euler characteristics are invariants that separate many-valued tautologies from non-tautologies. Further, we offer an initial investigation of the linear structure of these generalised characteristics. Our second main result is that the collection of many-valued characteristics forms a linearly independent set in the real vector space of all valuations of Gödel logic over finitely many propositional variables.",

In this work a superhydrophobic coating was prepared on 7075 aluminium alloy surface by laser texturing and coating with a perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) self- assembled molecule. A falling droplet impacted the FDTS superhydrophobic coating and froze on it. Then continuous freezing and thawing were carried out on the FDTS superhydrophobic coating. The result shows that the adhesion between FDTS superhydrophobic coating and droplet is extremely small. Droplet can bounce off the surface, even in cold weather. Freezing of droplet on the FDTS superhydrophobic coating lasts 582 seconds, much longer than that of unmodified 7075 aluminium alloy surface. Also, the FDTS superhydrophobic coating has high wear resistance and can resist freezing and thawing permanently.",

Second, the grey gradient direction of the edge points are calculated as the normal direction of light stripe curve, and the cross-section of light stripe can be obtained along the normal direction. Finally, a closed solution for extracting light stripe centre is given based on spatial moment theory, and the sub-pixel coordinates of light stripe centre can be obtained in all cross-sections.The experimental result demonstrates that this moment-based detection algorithm is more robustness against the noise, and its run time is much faster than the other methods. The above advantages indicate this algorithm is more suitable for on-line accurate detection.",

The broadened pulse is recompressed using compressor such as pair of gratings or chirped mirrors in order to achieve simplified thin-film compressor with compression factor of 11. The Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE) is solved numerically to examine the combined effect of normal group velocity dispersion (GVD) and self-phase modulation (SPM) in PMMA polymer. The effects of PMMA polymer thickness and input pulse intensity on the broadening factor are studied. It is noticed that higher time broadening factors could be obtained by increasing the input intensity and using larger thicknesses of PMMA. Depression of Small Scale Self Focusing (SSSF) effect is discussed in order to achieve the optimum conditions of laser pulse compression. Lower B-integral values are corresponding with input pulse intensities lower than 1 TW/cm2 and polymer thickness shorter than 100 μm.",

The results of optimising the laser beam parameters to produce sound welds with small heat affected zones (HAZ) when changes occur in the weld dimensions, as a result of a change in the laser beam parameters, are also discussed.

    "abstract": "Performance measurement is a vital phase for a sustainable assessment. To procure an accurate performance evaluation, it is crucial to consider all of the alternatives with respect to the measurement criteria based on the available data. In this context, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods can be consider as one of the most appropriate approaches such a problem environment. Since the performance evaluations do not only consist of cardinal information but also are based on decision makers’ experience which can be categorized as linguistic information, the classical MCDM methods are not capable to reflect the fullest extent of the data. As a result of that, it would be more appropriate and accurate to evaluate performances of tennis players by utilizing fuzzy logic approach instead of classical MCDM methods. In this study, a fuzzy based MCDM model consists of Delphi, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has been proposed for performance evaluation extended with Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs), for an appropriate assessment process. The criteria and alternatives have been determined by using Delphi method. The weights of the criteria are obtained by using PF AHP and final ranking of the players are determined by using PF TOPSIS. Also, one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the flexibility of the obtained results. The obtained results showed that instead of using only the statistical data, a fuzzy based MCDM methodology which can represent both statistical and linguistic data is more suitable for the performance evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Membrane computing is an important and newly-emerging branch of natural computing. As the basic type of membrane computing models, a cell-like P system consists of three basic elements: membrane structure, initial objects and evolution rules. The automatic design of a cell-like P system in the existing literature considered a simplified case, i.e., the selection of evolution rules from a predefined set of redundant evolution rules on the condition that the membrane structure and initial objects were fixed. How to automatically design a cell-like P system by simultaneously considering its three basic elements is a challenging and ongoing issue. In this paper, we propose an automatic design approach for a cell-like P system, by tuning its three key elements, membrane structures, initial objects and evolution rules, simultaneously and in an interrelated manner. In this method, a binary encoding technique is used to codify the P system with variable membrane structures, initial objects and evolution rules; an elitist genetic algorithm is applied to evolve a population of P systems toward a successful P system for fulfilling a specific task; an effective fitness function is employed to evaluate each candidate P system by using a P-lingua simulator. The parameter setting is also discussed. Experimental results show that the introduced method can successfully accomplish the automatic design of a cell-like P system for calculating the square of 4.",

Different weld profiles in aluminium and stainless steel were correlated with various combinations of parameters for a wide range of beam diameters. It has been shown that the same penetration depth can be achieved with different weld profiles. A similar trend, as previously found in macrowelding, has been confirmed in microwelding.

We first give a recipe of an experimental setup that is capable of measuring and recording the vacuum fluctuations with the help of our cw Nd:YAG laser. The basic scheme simply involves the Nd:YAG laser, detectors and some radio frequency electronic components. The laser source used in the demonstration provides us with a quantum noise limited CW at a radio frequency sideband of 14 MHz. The final data obtained after appropriate electronic signal processing are digitized voltage fluctuations that correspond to the vacuum fluctuations in the optical domain. The data randomly lies above or below zero due to its quantum mechanical probabilistic nature. We assign a ‘1’ to the data that is positive and a ‘0’ to the data that is negative, hence we are able to generate a random bit sequence by using a cw Nd:YAG laser. This result adds yet another interesting application to the many number of broad applications of the Nd:YAG laser system.",

For the purpose of representation, we consider formulas (including special formulas of an infinite length) which are constructed from variables and constants from [0, 1] with the help of operations from a BL-algebra. We prove that the class of functions which are represented by such formulas coincides with the class of extensional functions. The proof is based on the uniform representation by the generalized normal (disjunctive and conjunctive) forms. Moreover, the class of these functions coincides with the class of Lipschitz continuous functions in the case of BL-algebra whose t-norm has a continuous additive generator.",

This paper briefly introduced distributed optical fiber temperature sensor and time domain signal averaging technology used for enhancing digital signal. Then, the distributed optical fiber temperature sensor system was tested by constant temperature water bath box. The spatial resolution, temperature resolution and measurement time of the system under 150, 1500 and 15000 times of signals accumulation were compared. The results showed that time domain signal averaging technology could effectively suppress noise signals, and the more the signal accumulated, the better the suppression effect was and the clearer and smoother the temperature signal curve was; the spatial resolution and temperature resolution of the system increased with the increase of the number of accumulations, and tended to be flat, while the measuring time increased greatly with the increase of the number of accumulations. In conclusion, the time domain signal averaging technology can effectively enhance the weak temperature signal in the optical fiber sensor, but the signal accumulation times need to be set according to the actual measurement accuracy and efficiency.",

In order to improve the control effect of the robot, a non-linear proportion, integration and differentiation (NLPID) controller was designed in this study. Firstly, the dynamic model of the robot was established. Then, the traditional PID control method was introduced. On the basis of the PID, the NLPID controller was designed, and the stability of the NLPID controller was analyzed theoretically. Finally, the robot model and the control method were simulated in the MATLAB environment. The simulation results have shown that the three-axis error of the robot was smaller under the control of NLPID compared with the traditional PID control method, and it could reach the desired position in about 1 s. The circular and linear trajectory tracking also found that the trajectory under the control of NLPID basically conformed to the desired trajectory and had a good control effect.",

Based on the moments method the evolution of a cosh-Gaussian beam width in the root-meansquare (RMS) sense has been analytically described. The critical powers and beam quality factors of the cosh-Gaussian beams are demonstrated. By using numerical simulation it was found that although the beam RMS width broadens, the central parts of the beam give rise to radial compression and significant redistribution occurs during propagation. The partial collapse of the centre parts of the beam appears below the threshold for a global collapse as predicted by the moments method. When the initial power is low and moderate the cosh-Gaussian beam eventually converts into a cos-Gaussian type beam in Kerr media.",

In previous work we have developed, within the abstract language of category theory, some interesting tools for providing a foundation to the development of a general framework for unification, working with powersets of terms. Monads, in this context, establish an essential concept in that they contain set functors with structure provided by natural transformations. In this paper we show how monads, extended to partially ordered monads, can be used to generalize and interpret rough situations. In particular, the partially ordered ordinary power set monad turns out to contain sufficient structure in order to provide rough set operations. This study of rough sets from a categorical view, provides an abstract tool to handle properties of the structure increasing their understanding in a basic many-valued logic setting.",

This problem has already been studied for continuous systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). The concept of controllability was first identified by R. Kalman in 1960. In linear systems analysis the Kalman rank condition is omnipresent and was used to obtain the main characterization results on controllability. The purpose of this paper is to study this concept applied to Cellular Automata models considered as the discrete counterpart of PDEs. We focus on regional controllability that considers objectives to be achieved only on a subregion of the whole domain and the controls exerted on the boundary of the target region. We prove the regional controllability of two dimensional deterministic linear cellular automata by exploring a new approach based on Markov chains. The extension to non-linear CA has also been studied.",
